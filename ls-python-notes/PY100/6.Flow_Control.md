# Flow Control

- **Flow Control** is the path that you want your data to take when writing programs.

## Conditionals

- Fork(s) in the road. Python evaluates the conditional and tells the data where to go.
- **Block** is one or more Python statements or expressions.
- `else` block isn't a proper statement; it's part of the `if` statement.
- You have as many `elif` blocks as you need. They are evaluated in the order they appear in the code.
- All statements in a block must be indented from the statement that begins the block. The indentation in a block must be consistent.
- Every once in a while, you may want to create a block in an `if` statement that does nothing. We usually do this for readability purposes. However, blocks can't be empty. Instead, you have to use a `pass` statement.

## Comparisons

- Comparison operators return a Boolean value: `True` or `False`.
- **Operands** are the expressions to the left and right of an operator.

### The **equality operator** (`==`)

- The **equality operator** returns `True` when the operands have equal values, `False` otherwise.
- In most cases, operands must have the same type and value to be equal. Thus, `5` is not equal to `'5'`. There are some places where you can mix types, however. For instance, integers and floats that are mathematically equivalent are usually, but not always, considered equal:

```python
print(5 == float(5))                # True

big_num = 12345678901234567
print(float(big_num) == big_num)    # False
```

- While `casefold` is only needed when working with non-US characters, it's best practice in Python to use `casefold` instead of `lower` or `upper`, especially when comparing strings. **(Check this with LSBot**).

### The **inequality operator** (`!=`)

- is `==`'s inverse: It returns `False` when `==` would return `True`, and `True` when `==` would return `False`. It returns `False` when the operands have the same type and value, `True` otherwise. Other than the return value, the behaviors of `==` and `!=` are identical.

### The **less than operator** (`<`) and **less than or equal to operator** (`<=`)

- The **less than operator** (`<`) returns `True` when the value of the left operand has a value that is less than the value on the right, `False` otherwise. The **less than or equal to operator** (`<=`) is similar, but it also returns `True` when the values are equal; `<` returns `False` when the operands are equal.
- Python compares strings character-by-character, moving from left to right. It looks for the first character that differs from its counterpart in the other string. Once it finds differing characters, it compares them to determine the relationship. If both strings are equal up to the shorter string's length, as in the last two examples, the shorter one is considered less than the longer one.

```python
print('42' < '402')       # False
print('42' < '420')       # True
print('420' < '42')       # False
```

### The **greater than operator** (`>`) and **greater than or equal to operator** (`>=`)

- The **greater than operator** (`>`) returns `True` when the value of the left operand has a value that is greater than the value on the right, `False` otherwise. The **greater than or equal to operator** (`>=`) is similar, but it also returns `True` when the values are equal; `>` returns `False` when the operands are equal.
- As with `<` and `<=`, you can compare strings with the `>` and `>=` operators; the rules are similar.
