# Data Types

- Everything done in Python involves data and data types.
- Everything with a value in Python is an **object**.
- Each **object** has a **type** and an associated **class**. 

## Data Types in Python

| Data Type    | Class       | Category                | Kind          | Mutable |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| integers     | `int`       | numerics                | Primitive     | No      |
| floats       | `float`     | numerics                | Primitive     | No      |
| boolean      | `bool`      | booleans                | Primitive     | No      |
| strings      | `str`       | text sequences          | Primitive     | No      |
| ranges       | `range`     | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive | No      |
| tuples       | `tuple`     | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive | No      |
| lists        | `list`      | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive | **Yes** |
| dictionaries | `dict`      | mappings (collections)  | Non-primitive | **Yes** |
| sets         | `set`       | sets (collections)      | Non-primitive | **Yes** |
| frozen sets  | `frozenset` | sets (collections)      | Non-primitive | No      |
| functions    | `function`  | functions               | Non-primitive | **Yes** |
| `NoneType`   | `NoneType`  | nulls                   | _--?--_       | No      |

### What is a primitive type?

Is the most fundamental data type in a language.

### What is the definition of mutable/immutable?

* Mutable types are types whose objects can be changed after they are created.
* Immutable types cannot be changed after they are created.

## Literals

Is any syntactic notation used to represent an object in source code. These are the literals in Python:

```python
'Hello, world!'   # str literal
3.141592          # float literal
True              # bool literal
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}  # dict literal
[1, 2, 3]         # list literal
(4, 5, 6)         # tuple literal
{7, 8, 9}         # set literal
```

Not all objects have literal forms, for those the type constructor is used to create objects of the type:

```python
range(10)         # Range of numbers: 0-9
range(1, 11)      # Range of numbers: 1-10
set()             # Empty set
frozenset([1, 2]) # Frozen set of values: 1 and 2
```

## Numeric Values

- Represent numbers

### Integers

- Data Type: `int`
- Can't use commas or periods for grouping: `123,456,789` nor `123.456.789`.
- Can write the number without separators or break up the number with underscores: `123_456_789`. 

### Floats

- Data Type: `float`
- Can't use commas or periods for grouping: `42,348,912.346` nor `42.348.912,346`.
- Can write the number without separators or break up the number with underscores: `42_348.912_346`.

## Variables and Assignment

- **Variables** are names used to identify values (data)
- The syntax used when creating variables `foo = 'abc'` is called **assignment**. 
- When a variable is assigned a value for the first time, the assignment is called **initialization**.
- If the variable is already initialized, the assignment is called **reassignment**. 

## Boolean values

- Data Type: **bool** 
- The only Boolean values are: `True` and `False` 
- Sometimes act like numeric values: `True == 1` and `False == 0`.

## Text Sequences

- **Text sequences** are strings of characters.
- A **string** is a text sequence of Unicode characters.
- The difference between a **Text sequence** and an **ordinary sequence** is that the **ordinary sequence** contain zero or more objects, while the **text sequence** does not contain any objects: only contains the characters (which are not objects in itself) that make up the text sequence.

### String Literals

- String **literals** can be written with single, double or triple quotes.

```python
'Hi there'                      # Single quotes
"Monty Python's Flying Circus"  # Double quotes

# Triple single quotes
'''King Arthur: "What is your name?"
Black Knight: "None shall pass!"
King Arthur: "What is your quest?"
Black Knight: "I have no quarrel with you,
               but I must cross this bridge."
'''

# Triple double quotes
"""Man: "Is this the right room for an argument?"
Other Man: "I've told you once."
Man: "No you haven't!"
"""
```

- The backslash, or escape character (`\`), tells the computer that the next character isn't syntactic but is part of the string.

```python
print('My nickname is "Wolfy". What\'s yours?')
print("My nickname is \"Wolfy\". What's yours?")
```

### Indexing Strings

- To access the individual characters in a string, use the `[ ]` **indexing syntax**.
- The value between the brackets must be an integer between 0 and the length of the string minus 1:

```python
>>> my_str = 'abc' 
>>> my_str[0]
a 
>>> my_str[1] 
b 
>>> my_str[2]
c
```

- You can also use negative integers to access characters based on the distance from the end of the string. For instance, `my_str[-1]` returns the last character in the string, while `my_str[-2]` returns the next to last character. The index of the first character is given by `-len(my_str)`:

```python
>>> my_str = 'abc'
>>> my_str[-1]
c
>>> my_str[-2]
b 
>>> my_str[-3]
a
```

### Raw Strings and f-Strings

- String literals with an `r` prefix are **raw string literals**. Raw string literals don't recognize escapes, so you can use literal `\` characters freely.

```python
# Both of these print C:\Users\Xyzzy
print("C:\\Users\\Xyzzy")  # Each \\ produces a literal \
print(r"C:\Users\Xyzzy")  # raw string literal
```

- String literals with an `f` are **formatted string literals** or **f-strings**. These enable **string interpolation**.

```python
>>> f'5 plus 5 equals {5 + 5}.' 
'5 plus 5 equals 10.' 
>>> my_name = 'Karl' 
>>> f'My name is {my_name}.' 
'My name is Karl.' 
>>> my_name = 'Clare' 
>>> greeting = 'Ey up?' 
>>> f'{greeting} My name is {my_name}.' 
'Ey up? My name is Clare.
```

## Functions

- Are chunks of standalone, reusable code designed to perform an action.
- Data Type: `functions`.

## None

- Data Type: `NoneType`
- Literal: `None`
- Express the absence of a value.

## Sequences

- Represent an ordered collection of objects.
- The objects can be accessed using a numeric index.

### Lists and Tuples

- May contain any objects.
- List literals: `[]`
- Tuples literals: `()`
- The comma-delimited values are known as **elements**
- Use indexing syntax to retrieve specific elements.
- Use indexing syntax to reassign specific list elements. (**Element reassignment**)
- Lists are **mutable**. 
- Tuples are **immutable**.

```python
>>> my_list = [1, 'xyz', True, [2, 3, 4]] 
>>> my_list 
[1, 'xyz', True, [2, 3, 4]] 
>>> tup = ('xyz', [2, 3, 4], 1, True) 
>>> tup 
('xyz', [2, 3, 4], 1, True)
```

```python
>>> my_list[3] = 'New value' 
>>> my_list 
[1, 'xyz', True, 'New value']
```

- When creating a tuple with a single element a comma must be placed after the element value: `my_tuple = (1,)`

## Ranges

- A **range** is a sequence of integers between two endpoints.
- Are most commonly used to iterate over an increased or decreased range of integers.
- **range** doesn't produce the integers before a program ask for it. This optimizes memory. They are lazy sequences.

```python
>>> tuple(range(5))
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

>>> tuple(range(5, 10))
(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

>>> list(range(1, 10, 2))
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

>>> list(range(0, -5, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4]

>>> my_range = range(5, 10)
>>> my_range[3]               # 8
```

## Mappings

- represent an unordered collection of objects stored as key-value pairs.
- Each key is a unique identifier for a specific object in the mapping.
- The dictionary is the most common mapping in Python.
- Literal: **dict** {}
- Elements are separated by commas. {key:value,...}
- You can access objects in a dict with the `[ ]` key access syntax
- You can use almost any immutable object as a key in a dict; it doesn't have to be a string
- The only significant requirement for keys is that they are hashable. immutable types are almost always hashable, while mutable types are almost always non-hashable.

```python
my_dict = {
    'title': "Monty Python's Flying Circus",
    'cast': [
        'Eric Idle',
        'John Cleese',
        'Terry Gilliam',
        'Graham Chapman',
        'Michael Palin',
        'Terry Jones',
    ],
    'first_season': 1969,
    'last_season': 1974,
    'reboot_season': None,
}
```

## Sets

- represent an unordered collection of unique objects; the objects are called the **members** of the set.
- Sets are similar to mappings, except instead of using keys and values, a set is simply a collection of immutable (and _hashable_) objects.
- Literal: `{value1, value2, value3,}` 
- Empty sets must be created with the set constructor: `set()` 
- There are two set types: ordinary sets (class `set`) and frozen sets (class `frozenset`)
- Frozen sets are immutable and lack literal syntax. The function **frozenset** must be used to create one.
- You can use almost any immutable value as a set member.The only significant requirement is that the objects must be hashable.
