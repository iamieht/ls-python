# Basic Operations

## Kinds of Types

- **Built-in**: they are part of Python.
- **Standard**: Available from modules that can be imported into your programs. (ex. math)
- **Non-Standard**: third party or own

## Arithmetic Operations

| Operator | Operation                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `+`      | [[#Addition]]                |
| `-`      | [[#Subtraction]]             |
| `*`      | [[#Multiplication]]          |
| `/`      | [[#Division]]                |
| `//`     | [[#Integer division]]        |
| `%`      | [[#Modulo]]                  |
| `**`     | [[#Exponentiation (powers)]] |
### Addition

```python
print(5 + 5)     # 25
print(5.0 + 5.0) # 10.0
# mixing integers and floats
print(5 + 5.0)   # 10.0
```

### Subtraction

```python
print(5 - 5)     # 0
print(5.0 - 5.0) # 0.0
# mixing integers and floats
print(5 - 5.0)   # 0.0
```

### Multiplication

```python
print(5 * 5)     # 25
print(5.0 * 5.0) # 25.0
# mixing integers and floats
print(5 * 5.0)   # 25.0
```

### Division 

```python
print(15 / 3)   # 5.0
print(19 / 2.5) # 7.6
```

### Integer Division

```python
print(16 // 3)     # 5
print(16 // -3)    # -6
print(16 // 2.3)   # 6.0
print(-16 // 2.3)  # -7.0
```

- The `//` operator returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the floating point result. This is quite simple when you visualize a number line: -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. Let's start at zero. Going right means the numbers _increase,_ whilst going left means the numbers _decrease_. So, integer division indeed returns the largest whole number _less than or equal to_ (<=) the floating-point result: 16//3 -> 5.33333...  -> 5 (because rounding 5.33333 _down_ gives us 5 (find the floating-point result on the number line and move _left_))So... now let's consider 16//-3.  16//-3 -> -5.33333... -> ? (well, if we consult our number line again, our dear -5 "sits" between -6 and -5. Which of these two numbers is _less_ (i.e. to the _left_)? Well, -6. So, this means rounding -5.33333... _down_ results in -6)

### Exponentiation (powers)

```python
print(16 ** 3)     # 4096
```

### Modulo

- The `%` operator is called the **modulo operator**.
- The result of the operation is called a modulus and not remainder.
- As long as both numbers have the same sign, modulo and remainder are equivalent operations.
- There is one situation where you can safely use `%` without worrying about negative numbers: when you only care about divisibility. If `x % y == 0`, then `x` is evenly divisible by `y`. It doesn't matter whether `x` or `y` is negative.

```python
# 15 // 3 is 5; what's the remainder?
print(15 % 3)   # 0
print(16 % 3)   # 1
print(17 % 3)   # 2
print(18 % 3)   # 0
```

### Floating Point Imprecision

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)       # False
```

- One way around the problem in Python is to use the `math.isclose` function:

```python
import math
math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)  # True
```

- You can also use the `decimal.Decimal` type to make precise computations:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2') == Decimal('0.3')
# True
```

- always use strings with `decimal.Decimal`. You can use float values. However, you will lose the benefit of precise computation if you do.
