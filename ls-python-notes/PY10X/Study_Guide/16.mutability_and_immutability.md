# Mutability and Immutability

## What is the definition of mutable/immutable?

* Mutable types are types whose objects can be changed after they are created.
* Immutable types cannot be changed after they are created.

## Mutable objects

Mutable objects can be modified after creation. In Python, these include:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- User-defined classes (by default)

## Immutable objects

Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation. In Python, these include:

- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Tuples
- Frozensets

Understanding mutability helps predict how your code will behave and is essential for avoiding unexpected side effects in your programs.
