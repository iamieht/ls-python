# Variables

## Definitions

- **Variables** are labels that point to values in memory
- **Identifiers** refer to: 
	- Variable and constant names
	- Function and method names
	- Function and method parameter names
	- Class and module names

## Naming Conventions

- Names that follow the naming conventions are called **idiomatic**
- Names that do not follow the naming conventions are called **non-idiomatic**
- Names that are not allowed are called **illegal**

### Naming conventions for most identifiers (except constants and class names):

- Use **snake_case**.
- Names may contain: (`a-z`), (`0,9`) and (`_`).
- Names should begin with a letter.
- When using multiple words, separate them with a single (`_`).
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set. (Extended ASCII and Unicode letters and digits are allowed, but are **non-idiomatic** )

### Naming conventions for Constant names:

- Use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**.
- Names may contain: (`A-Z`), (`0,9`) and (`_`).
- Names should begin with a letter.
- When using multiple words, separate them with a single (`_`).
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set. (Extended ASCII and Unicode letters and digits are allowed, but are **non-idiomatic** )

### Naming conventions for Class names:

- Use **PascalCase**, also called **CamelCase** .
- Names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters (`A-Z, a-z`) and digits (`0-9`).
- Names should begin with an uppercase letter.
- When using multiple words, capitalize each word.

### Illegal names:

- You may not use punctuation characters, most special characters, or whitespace.
- You may not start identifiers with a digit.
- You may not use Python's reserved words such as `if`, `def`, `while`, `return`, and `pass` as names.

## Creating and Reassigning Variables

- We create (**initialize**) a variable by simply giving it a value. That happens as part of an assignment statement:

```python
forename = 'Clare'            # initialization
```

- We can also give new values to variables by simply **reassigning** them:

```python
forename = 'Victor'           # reassignment
```

- Way to describe an assignment: The variable `foo`is assigned the value of `bar`.

## Creating Constants

- Constants are created (**initialized**) in the same way as variables: by giving them a value:

```python
PINING_FOR = 'fjords'         # initialization
```

- Constants should never be reassigned.
- Python does not support true constants. Instead, the **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** naming convention is solely for programmers.

## Augmented Assignment

- It's a shorthand notation also called **assignment operators**, of the process of taking the current value of a variable, perform an operation on the variable's value, and then reassign the variable to the newly computed value.
- **Augmented assignment** is a statement, not an expression. You can't use augmented assignment as a function argument or return value

```python
foo = 42            # foo is 42
foo -= 2            # foo is now 40
foo *= 3            # foo is now 120
foo += 5            # foo is now 125
foo //= 25          # foo is now 5
foo /= 2            # foo is now 2.5
foo **= 3           # foo is now 15.625
print(foo)          # prints 15.625

def foo(bar):
    print(bar)

a = 3
foo(a *= 2)
#     ^^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

def foo():
    a = 3
    return a *= 2
#            ^^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## Reassignment vs. Mutation

- There are two ways to change things in Python:
	- Change the **binding** of the variable by making it reference a new object (**Reassignment**)
	- Change the value of the object assigned (**bound**) to the variable (**Mutation**).
- **Reassignment** makes the variable name refer to a different object somewhere else in memory.
- **Mutation** does not change which object the variable refers to, instead it changes the object itself. After mutating an object assigned to a specific variable, the variable continues to refer to the same object (albeit altered) at the same memory location.
- **Reassigning** an element of a mutable collection doesn't reassign the variable; it mutates the collection.

```python
num = 3               # assignment (initialization)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]   # assignment (initialization)
my_dict = {           # assignment (initialization)
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
}

num = 42              # Reassignment
my_list[1] = 42       # Reassignment of element,
                      # my_list is mutated!
my_dict['b'] = 3      # Reassignment of dict pair
                      # my_dict is mutated!

# You can still reassign the variables
my_list = [2, 3, 4]   # Reassignment
my_dict = { 'x': 0 }  # Reassignment
```

## Variable Scope

Variable scope refers to the parts of a program where a variable can be accessed by name.

Python has two main types of scope:

### Global scope

Variables defined outside of any function have global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in your program.

```python
num = 5  # Global variable

def my_func():
    print(num)  # Can access the global variable

my_func()  # Outputs: 5
```

### Local scope

Variables defined inside a function have local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function.

```python
def my_func():
    local_var = 10  # Local variable
    print(local_var)

my_func()  # Outputs: 10
print(local_var)  # This would cause an error - local_var is not defined here
```


## `global` keyword

You can access global variables inside a function:

```python
num = 5

def my_func():
    print(num)  # Accessing is fine

my_func()  # Outputs: 5
```

But if you try to assign to a global variable inside a function, Python will create a new local variable instead:

```python
num = 5

def my_func():
    num = 10  # Creates a new local variable, not modifying the global one

my_func()
print(num)  # Still outputs: 5
```

To modify a global variable inside a function, use the `global` keyword:

```python
num = 5

def my_func():
    global num
    num = 10  # Now modifies the global variable

my_func()
print(num)  # Outputs: 10
```

### **Common Pitfall**

Be careful when you try to modify a global variable before declaring it as global:

```python
my_var = "Hello"

def my_func():
    my_var = my_var + " world"  # Error: UnboundLocalError
    return my_var

my_func()
```

This happens because Python sees the assignment to `my_var` and treats it as a local variable, but then tries to use it before it's been assigned a value.
## Variables as Pointers

In Python, variables don't actually contain values directly. Instead, they act as references or pointers to objects in memory.

### **How Variables Work in Python**

When you create a variable in Python, what actually happens is:

1.  Python creates an object in memory to store the value  
2.  Python then associates the variable name with a reference (or pointer) to that object's location in memory

```python
number = 42
```

In this example, Python:
- Creates an integer object with value 42 in memory
- Associates the name 'number' with the memory location of that object

### **Variable Assignment**

When you assign a value to a variable, you're creating a new reference:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]  # 'a' points to a list object
b = a          # 'b' now points to the SAME list object
```

Both `a` and `b` point to the same list object in memory. This has important implications when working with mutable objects.

### **Mutability and References**

The pointer concept becomes especially important when considering mutable vs. immutable objects:

#### **With Mutable Objects (lists, dictionaries, sets):**

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a          # both variables point to the same list
b.append(4)    # modifies the list that both variables point to
print(a)       # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

When you modify a mutable object through one variable, the change is visible through all variables pointing to that object.

#### **With Immutable Objects (numbers, strings, tuples):**

```python
a = 5
b = a
b = 10         # creates a new integer object, reassigns b to point to it
print(a)       # Output: 5 (unchanged)
```

For immutable objects, any "modification" actually creates a new object and updates the reference.

#### **Checking Identity with `id()`**

You can verify that variables point to the same object using the `id()` function:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(id(a) == id(b))  # Output: True - they point to the same object
```


## Variable Shadowing

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, effectively "hiding" or "shadowing" the outer variable.

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def my_func():
    x = 20  # Local variable shadows the global variable
    print(f"Inside function: {x}")  # Accesses the local x

my_func()
print(f"Outside function: {x}")  # Accesses the global x
```

This code would output:

```python
Inside function: 20  
Outside function: 10
```

### **Why This Happens**

In Python, when you assign a value to a variable inside a function without declaring it as `global`, Python creates a new local variable instead of modifying the global one. This new local variable with the same name "shadows" the global variable within that function's scope.

Consider this slightly more complex example:

```python
def my_func():
    x = 15  # Local to my_func
    
    def inner_func1():
        x = 25  # Local to inner_func1, shadows my_func's x
        print(f"Inner 1: {x}")
        
    def inner_func2():
        print(f"Inner 2: {x}")  # Uses my_func's x
        
    inner_func1()
    inner_func2()

my_func()
```

Output:

```python
Inner 1: 25
Inner 2: 15
```

- The variable `x` in `inner_func1` shadows the `x` from `my_func`
- `inner_func2` doesn't define its own `x`, so it accesses the `x` from the outer scope (`my_func`)

### **Why Understanding Variable Shadowing Matters**

Variable shadowing is important to understand because:
- It can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of it
- It makes your code harder to debug when variables with the same name exist in different scopes
- It's a common source of bugs for programmers new to Python's scoping rules
