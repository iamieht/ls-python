# Pass by Object Reference

This concept explains how arguments are handled when passing to functions. 

## What is it?

In Python, when you pass an argument to a function, you're actually passing a reference to the object, not the object itself. However, whether you can modify the original object depends on whether that object is mutable or immutable.

## Immutable objects

```python
def change_name(name):
    name = 'bob'  # reassignment

name = 'jim'
change_name(name)
print(name)  # Output: jim
```

In this example, the string `'jim'` is immutable. When the function tried to reassign the parameter `name`, it only modified the local variable inside the function, not the original variable outside the function.

Here Python behaves as if "Pass-by-Value"

## Mutable Objects

```python
def add_element(my_list):
    my_list.append([4])  # modifying the object

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
add_element(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4]]
```

Here, the list is mutable, and when we use a method like `append()` that modifies the list in-place, the original list outside the function is also modified.

## Reassignment vs. Modification

```python
def add_element(my_list):
    my_list = my_list + [4]  # reassignment, not modification

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
add_element(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

In this case, even though lists are mutable, the operation `my_list = my_list + [4]` is a reassignment operation, not a modification. This creates a new list object and assigns it to the local variable `my_list`, without affecting the original list.

## The Key to Understanding

The behavior in Python is neither pure "pass by value" nor pure "pass by reference" - it's a hybrid approach called "pass by object reference." Here's what this means:

- Python always passes references to objects, never copies of the objects themselves
- For immutable objects (strings, numbers, tuples), you cannot modify the object itself
- For mutable objects (lists, dictionaries, sets), you can modify the object if you use methods that change the object in-place
- Reassignment of a parameter always creates a new local variable, regardless of whether the object is mutable or immutable
