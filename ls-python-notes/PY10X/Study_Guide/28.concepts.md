## Python Syntax and Language Fundamentals

### Data Types

Built-in data types:

| Data Type                                        | Class       | Category                | Kind          | Mutable | Immutable |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------- | --------- |
| [integers](PY10X/Study_Guide/4.numbers#Integers) | `int`       | numerics                | Primitive     |         | X         |
| [floats](PY10X/Study_Guide/4.numbers#Floats)     | `float`     | numerics                | Primitive     |         | X         |
| [boolean](8.boolean_vs_truthiness)               | `bool`      | booleans                | Primitive     |         | X         |
| [strings](5.strings)                             | `str`       | text sequences          | Primitive     |         | X         |
| [ranges](12.ranges.md)                           | `range`     | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive |         | X         |
| [tuples](13.lists)                               | `tuple`     | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive |         | X         |
| [lists](13.lists)                                | `list`      | sequences (collections) | Non-primitive | X       |           |
| [dictionaries](15.dictionaries)                  | `dict`      | mappings (collections)  | Non-primitive | X       |           |
| sets                                             | `set`       | sets (collections)      | Non-primitive | X       |           |
| frozen sets                                      | `frozenset` | sets (collections)      | Non-primitive |         | X         |
| [functions](25.functions)                        | `function`  | functions               | Non-primitive | X       |           |
| [`NoneType`](9.none)                             | `NoneType`  | nulls                   | _--?--_       |         | X         |

### Variables Naming Conventions

**Concepts:**

- **idiomatic**: the Python's naming conventions are followed (Python Enhancements Proposal - PEP8)
- **non-idiomatic**: the Python's naming conventions are not followed but the name is **legal**
- **illegal**: names that are syntactically incorrect or are using a Python's reserved word: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `pass`, `def`, `while`, `for`, `class`, `return`.

**Variables Naming Conventions:**

- Use of **snake_case**
- Names can contain `a-z` and `0-9`
- Cannot begin with a digit
- Names with multiple words must be separated by `_`

**Special Cases:**

- Names with double underscores on both sides like `__var__` are not idiomatic (except when specifically defined by Python).
- Non-ASCII characters (like `π`) are non-idiomatic.
- Words without separation (like `milesperhour`) are non-idiomatic.

**Illegal Names**:

* Punctuation characters, most special characters, and whitespaces are not allowed
* Names must not begin with a digit
* Python reserved words are not allowed: `if`, `def`, `while`, `for`, `return`, `class` and `pass`

### Constants Naming Conventions

- Use of **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**
- Names can contain `A-Z`and `0-9`
- Cannot begin with a digit
- Names with multiple words must be separated by `_`

### Variable Scope

Variables defined outside of any function have **global scope**, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in your program.

Variables defined inside a function have **local scope**, meaning they can only be accessed within that function.

### Assignment vs. Reassignment

### Variables as Pointers

### Variable Shadowing

### Global keyword

### Expressions vs. Statements

### Mutability vs. Immutability


## Operations and Control Flow
### Operators

### Conditionals Statements and Truthiness

### Loops
### Type Coercions

* Is the process of converting a value from one data type, implicitly or explicitly, to another data type.
* operations between values of the same type in Python don't require coercion.
* `print()` function implicitly converts any value to a string but this is not considered coercion.

**Implicit Coercion**

* Is one Python automatically transforms one data type into another, without any specific instruction.

**Explicit Coercion**

* Is when we intentionally transform the value of a data type into another with the use of built-in functions, such as `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

### F-strings

The concept demonstrated here is string interpolation using f-strings, which were introduced in Python 3.6 as a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals. f-strings automatically handle the conversion of non-string values to strings.

**Example**
Within the function, on line X, we use an f-string (formatted string literal) which is denoted by the `f` prefix before the string. The expression `{XXX}` within the curly braces is evaluated at runtime, and the value of the `name` variable (`'XXX'`) is converted to a string and inerpolated into the string. 

## Functions
### Function definition vs. Function invocation

### Parameters vs. Arguments

### Return Values vs. Side Effects

### Nested Functions

### Pass-by-Object-Reference


## Collections and String Operations

### String Methods

### List Methods

### Dictionary Methods

### Slicing

### Exception Handling

Is the process to manage or handle errors that might occur during the execution of a program.


## Other
### Mutation vs Reassignment

### Default Parameters

### Implicit vs. Explicit return values
