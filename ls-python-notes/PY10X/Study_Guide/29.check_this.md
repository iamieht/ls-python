## Python's Memory Model

Python's design elegantly handles many complex memory management tasks behind the scenes, making it much more accessible but also more abstract to the user. Python handles memory management automatically through a private heap space. 

#### What is Heap Space?

The heap is a memory area that stores objects whose lifetime is not determined by their scope - unlike stack memory, which manages function calls and local variables. Here are the key characteristics of heap space:

* **Dynamic Allocation**​: Memory is allocated and deallocated at runtime, not at compile time
* **​Flexible Size**​: The size of objects can be determined during execution
* **​Persistence**​: Objects can exist beyond the scope in which they were created
* **​Manual/Automatic Management**​: Depending on the language, heap memory may be managed manually or automatically

In Python, virtually all objects are stored on the heap. The Python memory manager controls memory allocation and deallocation behind the scenes, through a system called **​reference counting**​ combined with **​garbage collection**​:

1. **Object Model**​: Everthing is an object and it is on the heap. When you create a variable, you're creating a reference to an object, not the object itself. 

2. **​Reference Counting**​: Python keeps track of how many references point to each object. When the count drops to zero, the memory is typically freed immediately.
  
3. **​Garbage Collection**​: For handling circular references (objects referencing each other), Python has a cycle-detecting garbage collector that runs periodically.
  
4. **Object Reuse and Memory Pools**: Python uses object pools for small immutable objects like small integers and short strings. This means that multiple variables may point to the same object in memory, optimizing memory usage.

#### Heap vs Stack

To understand heap better, it helps to contrast it with stack memory:

| Heap                                  | Stack                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Stores objects with dynamic lifetime  | Stores function call information and local variables |
| Slower access                         | Faster access                                        |
| Manual or automatic management        | Automatic management based on scope                  |
| Can grow until physical memory limits | Limited size, can cause stack overflow               |
| Used for objects with variable size   | Used for fixed-size data

#### Object Creation and Storage

When you create an object in Python, several things happen: 

`x = 42  # Creates an integer object with value 42`

1. Python allocates memory for the integer object
2. The value `42` is stored in that memory location
3. The variable `x` becomes a reference (pointer) to that memory location
4. Increments the object's reference count to `1`. 

`my_list = [1, 2, 3]`

1.  Allocates memory on the heap for the list object
2.  Initializes the object with the provided values
3.  Creates a reference variable (`my_list`) that points to this object
4.  Increments the object's reference count to `1`

#### Reference Counting

Every time you create a new reference to an object, its' reference count increases. This includes:

* Variable assignments
* Passing objects to functions
* Storing objects in containers (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Creating closures that reference objects

Every object maintains a count of how many references point to it. The Python interpreter tracks these references by:

1.  Incrementing the reference count when a new reference to the object is created
2.  Decrementing the reference count when a reference goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Reference count: 1
y = x          # Reference count: 2
del x          # Reference count: 1
# When y goes out of scope, reference count becomes 0
```

Behind the scenes:

* Each Python object has a header containing its type, reference count, and other metadata
* The `sys.getrefcount()` function can show an object's reference count (though it adds one temporarily)

```python
import sys
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getrefcount(x))  # Shows count + 1 (due to the temporary reference as an argument)
```


#### Object Lifetime


Objects remain alive as long as at least one reference to them exists. Several operations affect an object's lifetime:

```python
def demonstrate_lifetime():
    x = [1, 2, 3]  # Object created, reference count: 1
    y = x          # Reference count: 2
    
    # Local functions can extend object lifetime
    def inner():
        print(x)
    
    return inner   # x's reference count stays at least 1 due to closure

func = demonstrate_lifetime()
# Even though demonstrate_lifetime has finished executing,
# the list [1, 2, 3] is still alive because func (inner) references it
```

References are removed when:
* Variables go out of scope
* Variables are reassigned
* Objects are removed from containers
* `del` statement is used

```python

a = [1, 2, 3]  # Reference count: 1
b = a          # Reference count: 2
del a          # Reference count: 1
b = None       # Reference count: 0 -> object becomes eligible for garbage collection
```


#### Memory Management and Garbage Collection

When an object's reference count drops to zero, Python's garbage collector reclaims that memory. 

```python
def create_list():
    temp_list = [1, 2, 3]
    return temp_list

result = create_list()
# temp_list is no longer accessible, its memory can be reclaimed
```


#### Everything is _actually_ an Object

1. **Primitive Types are Objects**: Unlike languages like C or Java where primitive types (`int`, `float`) are distinct from objects, in Python even these basic types are full-fledged objects:

```python
# Integers are objects
num = 5
print(dir(num))  # Shows all attributes and methods of the integer

# Even booleans are objects
truth = True
print(type(truth))  # <class 'bool'>
```

2. **Functions are Objects too**! Functions can be:

* Assigned to variables
* Passed as arguments
* Returned from other functions
* Have attributes added to them


3. Classes and Types are Objects: Even classes and types themselves are objects:

```python
print(type(int))  # <class 'type'>
```

[Back to the top](#top)

#### Object Identity

Every object has a unique identifier, accessed using the `id()` function. This function returns the identity of an object, which is guaranteed to be unique for the object's lifetime.

```python
a = 42
b = 42
print(id(a))  # Returns the memory address of a
print(id(a) == id(b))  # Might be True due to interning
```


To review, we know now that an object is a chunk of data that contains the following:

1.  **​An identity**​: A unique identifier (accessible via the id() function)
2.  **​A type**​: Determines what operations can be performed on it (accessible via `type()`)
3.  **​A value**​: The actual data it contains


#### Practical Implications

1. **References vs. Values**: In Python, _variables are references to objects, not containers for values_.

2. **Everything Has Methods and Attributes**: Since everything is an object, you can call methods on any value.

3. **Mutability vs. Immutabilit**y: Objects can be either mutable (can be changed) or immutable (cannot be changed):
* Immutable: int, float, str, tuple, frozenset
* Mutable: list, dict, set

[Back to the top](#top)

#### Value Interning

Python optimizes memory use by interning (reusing) certain immutable objects:

```python

a = 5
b = 5
print(a is b)  # True, because integers -5 to 256 are interned
```

In Python, there's a predefined range of integers, specifically from -5 to 256, for which memory locations are pre-assigned. When you reference an integer within this span, Python consistently points to the same memory spot.

What Python Interns:

1. **​Small integers**​: Integers in the range [-5, 256] are pre-allocated when Python starts.
2. **​Short strings**​: String literals that look like identifiers are interned.
3. **​Empty immutable containers**​: Empty tuples and frozensets are interned.

#### More about Short Strings Interning

An identifier in Python follows specific naming rules:
* Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
* Can be followed by letters, numbers, or underscores
* Cannot contain spaces or special characters

When a string literal looks like a valid Python identifier (like "`hello`", "`name1`", "`_test`"), Python automatically interns it. This means if you create multiple identical strings that look like identifiers, they will reference the same memory location.

```python

a = "hello"  # Looks like an identifier, will be interned
b = "hello"  # References the same memory location as 'a'
c = "hello!"  # Contains '!', doesn't look like an identifier, may not be interned

print(id(a) == id(b))  # True - same memory location
print(id(a) == id(c))  # Likely False - different memory locations
```

This behavior has a practical implication: you can use the `is` operator to check if two variables reference the exactly same object in memory, but for strings, the behavior might be confusing due to interning:

```python

x = "python"  # Interned
y = "python"  # Also interned, same object as x
z = "python!"  # Not interned

print(x is y)  # True (same object due to interning)
print(x is z)  # False (different objects)
```

However, it's important to note that you shouldn't rely on this behavior for equality testing. Always use the `==` operator to compare string values rather than `is`, which compares object identity. More on `is` in [Operators])(#operators).

### Mutable vs. Immutable Objects


Mutability & Immutability is directly related to how Python manages memory.

#### Immutable Objects

**Strings, tuples, and numbers are immutable and cannot be changed after creation**. Any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object and reassigning the reference. ​Immutable objects​ can be shared safely (via interning) since they can't be changed.

```python
s = "hello"
print(id(s))
s = s + " world"  # Creates a new string object
print(id(s))  # Different ID - new object
```

#### Mutable Objects

Lists, dictionaries, sets, custom classes allow for  operations to change the object itself without creating a new one. Operations that change them affect the same memory location. Mutable objects​ provide efficiency for operations that modify data in-place without creating copies.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
original_id = id(my_list)
my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the existing list
print(id(my_list) == original_id)  # True - same object
```

#### Mutability vs Immutability: Why its important

**Why the Distinction Exists**

Python's distinction between mutable and immutable objects wasn't arbitrary - it serves several important purposes:

1. **Memory Efficiency**
Immutable objects like integers, strings, and tuples allow Python to optimize memory usage. Since immutable objects can't change, Python can safely reuse them rather than creating new copies for every occurrence.

2. **Predictable Behavior**
The distinction helps create predictable behavior, especially when using objects as dictionary keys or in sets. ​Dictionary keys and set elements must be immutable​. This ensures that once an object is used as a key, its hash value won't change during the dictionary's lifetime.

[Back to the top](#top)

### Python's Parameter Passing Mechanism: Pass by Object Reference

Python uses what's commonly called "**pass by object reference**" (some also call it "pass by assignment"). This means:

1. When you pass a variable to a function, the function parameter becomes a new reference to the same object that the argument variable points to, not the variable itself. An independent copy of that variable is not created. 
2. Since the parameter variables inside the function become new references to the same objects, the reference count goes up.
3. Whether modifications inside the function affect the original object depends on whether the object is mutable or immutable

This explains some seemingly contradictory behaviors: 

```python

# Example with immutable object (string)
def change_name(name):
    name = 'bob'  # Reassignment creates new reference, doesn't affect original

name = 'jim'
change_name(name)
print(name)  # Still prints 'jim'

# Example with mutable object (list)
def add_element(my_list):
    my_list.append([4])  # Modifies the original object

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
add_element(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Prints [1, 2, 3, [4]] - original was modified!
```

Key Rules to Remember:

1. ​Reassignment​ creates a new reference and doesn't affect the original.
2. ​Mutation​ changes the object and affects all references.
3. This behavior applies to ​all data types​ but has different practical implications based on mutability.

### The Connection Between Mutability and Parameter Passing 

Here's how these concepts are connected:

1. **​For immutable objects**​: Since the object can't be modified, any operation that seems to modify it actually creates a new object. When a parameter is reassigned inside a function, what changes is what the object the local variable refers to. What is not affected is the original variable outside the function.

2.  **​For mutable objects**​: Since the object can be modified, operations that change the object's internal state affect the original object. Both the parameter and the original variable outside still point to the same object, so both "see" the changes.

3.  **​Reassignment vs. Modification**​:
* Reassignment never affects the original variable outside the function.
* Modification methods (e.g.,`.append()`, `.update()`) affect the original object if it's mutable.

Remember:

* Variables are not passed to functions; references to objects are passed.
* Parameters are the names in function definitions; arguments are the values passed.


#### Memory Aliasing

As we can now conclude, multiple variables can reference the same object. 

Memory aliasing occurs when multiple variables refer to the same object in memory. This is a fundamental concept in Python that's directly connected to its object reference model and has important implications for how code behaves.

**How Memory Aliasing Works**

When you assign a variable to another variable in Python, you're creating a new reference (or alias) to the same object
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Creates a list object in memory
y = x          # y now references the same list object
```

In this example, both `x` and `y` point to the same list object in memory. They are aliases of each other. This means the following can occur:

```python
y.append(4)    # Modifies the list through y
print(x)       # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] - x sees the change too!
```

**Consequences of Memory Aliasing**

1. **​Modification Effects**​: When using mutable objects, changes through one alias will be visible through all aliases.
2. **​Performance Implications**​: Aliasing can be memory-efficient since multiple variables share the same memory space instead of duplicating data.
3. **​Potential Bugs**​: Unwanted aliasing can lead to subtle bugs when you modify an object without realizing other parts of your code are referencing the same object.

**Avoiding Unwanted Aliasing**: when you want to create a separate copy instead of an alias, you need to explicitly copy the object.

**Aliasing and Function Arguments**

This concept is directly related to how Python passes arguments to functions. Since Python passes object references, function parameters become aliases to the objects passed as arguments.

### Differences from Other Languages

1. **Dynamic vs. Static Typing**: Unlike statically typed languages like Java or C++, Python uses dynamic typing:
* Variable types are determined at runtime
* Variables can be reassigned to different types
* No type declarations are required


What is typing, however? In programming, "typing" refers to the system that assigns and enforces data types for variables, expressions, and function returns.

Typing determines:
* What operations can be performed on a value
* How values can be stored in memory
* How the language handles type compatibility
* What errors may occur during program execution

#### Dynamic Typing

In dynamically typed languages like Python, type checking primarily happens at runtime:

* Variables don't have declared types - they can reference values of any type
* The type is associated with the value, not the variable
* Type errors are discovered when the code runs (during execution)
* Variables can change types throughout program execution

For example, in Python:
```python
x = 5         # x references an integer
x = "hello"   # x now references a string
x = [1, 2, 3] # x now references a list
```

Python evaluates the type of x at runtime based on the value it currently holds.

#### Static Typing

1. In statically typed languages (like Java, C++, or TypeScript):
* Variables have explicit type declarations
* Type checking happens at compile time, before the program runs
* Once a variable is declared with a type, it generally cannot reference values of other types
* Type errors are caught earlier in the development process

For example, in a statically typed language:

```
int x = 5;         // x can only hold integers
x = "hello";       // Error! Can't assign a string to an integer variable
```

* Runtime refers to the phase when your program is actually executing
* Compile time refers to the phase when your source code is translated into machine-readable code before the program is executed.


2. Interpreted vs. Compiled: Python is generally considered an interpreted language, although it technically compiles to bytecode first:
* Python code is compiled to bytecode (.pyc files)
* The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) interprets this bytecode

This differs from languages like C/C++ that compile directly to machine code.

You may be wondering about Python's execution process. Python actually follows a hybrid approach:

1.  **​Compilation Step​**: When a Python program runs,  the source code (.py files) is first compiled into bytecode (.pyc files), which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of one's code.
2.  **​Interpretation Step**​: This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which interprets the instructions at runtime.

Why Python Is Still Considered "Interpreted"?  Python is classified as interpreted for several key reasons:

* **​Runtime Execution**​: The compilation to bytecode happens automatically and transparently at runtime, rather than as a separate explicit step performed before execution.
* **​No Separate Compilation Phase**​: Unlike languages like C or Java, Python does not run a separate compiler that produces an executable or class file before running the program.
* **​Dynamic Nature**​: Python's highly dynamic features (like dynamic typing, runtime code generation, and dynamic binding) align more with interpreted languages.
* **​Historical Context**​: Languages have traditionally been categorized as either compiled or interpreted, even though many modern languages use hybrid approaches.

In reality, language implementation exists on a spectrum:

* ​Pure Compiled​: Languages like C and C++ compile directly to machine code
* ​Hybrid​: Languages like Java and C# compile to bytecode, then use a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler
* ​Python's Approach​: Compile to bytecode, then interpret that bytecode (with some JIT capabilities in implementations like PyPy)

This hybrid nature gives Python some benefits of both worlds - the portability of bytecode across different platforms while maintaining the flexibility and dynamic features of interpreted languages.


3. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: One significant difference is Python's Global Interpreter Lock:
* The GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time
* This simplifies memory management but can limit multi-threading performance
* This is a major difference from languages like Java or C# that support true concurrency

4. **Pass by Object Reference**: Python uses a "pass by object reference" model:
* When you assign variables or pass arguments, you're working with references to objects
* When you modify mutable objects (like lists), changes affect all references to that object
* When you reassign variables, you're creating new references. This behavior is sometimes described as "pass by assignment" and differs from strictly "pass by value" or "pass by reference" languages.

### Naming Conventions: legal vs. idiomatic, illegal vs. non-idiomatic

Readability of code is the core tenant of Python. Thus what and how naming occurs is of utmost importance.

Legal names​ in Python:

* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores only.
* Must start with a letter or underscore.

Illegal names​ violate these rules, such as:

* Names starting with numbers (1variable)
* Names containing spaces
* Names containing any other character that is not underscore (my-variable, variable!)
* Names that are Python keywords (if, class, for)


#### Idiomatic vs. Non-idiomatic Naming Conventions


Idiomatic naming refers to Python's style guide [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), while non-idiomatic naming doesn't. According to the ["PY101 - Coding Tips" lesson](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/73146c1c), idiomatic names depend on what you're naming:

* **Variables, functions, methods, module names, and arguments**​: Use snake_case (lowercase with underscores)
* **​Constants**​: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (all uppercase with underscores)
* **​Classes** and **Exceptions**​: Use PascalCase


```python

# Idiomatic
user_name = "John"              # Variable (snake_case)
total_score = 42                # descriptive names
temp_value = calculate_total()      #snake case with verb at the front
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit): #snake case with verb at the front
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9 

MAX_USERS = 100                 # Constant (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
PI = 3.14159                    # Constant (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
DATABASE_URL = 
"postgresql://localhost:5432"   # Constant (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)

class UserAccount:              # Class (PascalCase)
    pass
class UserAuthentication:       # Class (PascalCase)
    pass
class NPC:                      #Use all Caps for acronyms per Pep-8
```

**Non-idiomatic naming**​ refers to names that, while legally valid in Python (the code will run), don't follow Python's style conventions. 

```python
# Non-idiomatic (but legal)
userName = "John"        # camelCase for variables is not Python's style
Max_Users = 100          # Mixed case for constants
class user_account:      # snake_case for class names
    pass
```

Remember: 

* Variables and functions use snake_case
* Constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
* Classes use PascalCase (also called CamelCase or upper CamelCase)

## Variables

In Python, variables are names that refer to objects stored in memory. They work like labels that point to data rather than containers that hold data. 

**Initialization and Assignment**

Variable initialization​ is the first time a variable name is bound to a value. This creates the variable name in the current scope. Variable assignment​ is the operation of binding a name to an object (a value). In Python, this is done using the = operator.

`greeting = 'Hello'  # Initialization of the greeting variable`

This statement does two things:
1.  Creates an object (the string `'Hello'`)
2.  Associates the name `'greeting'` with this object

The variable becomes a reference (or pointer) to the object in memory. The variable (on the left of the `=`) becomes a reference or pointer to the object in memory. The expression to the right of the `=` evaluates to an object, which is stored on the heap.

A helpful analogy: "imagine objects as balloons, and variables as strings tied to those balloons. When you assign a value to a variable, you're tying a string (the variable) to a balloon (the object)"

**Reassignment**

Variable reassignment​ is when an existing variable name is bound to a new object (value).
When you reassign a variable, you're simply making it point to a different object:

```python
greeting = 'Hello'  # Initial assignment
greeting = 'Hi'     # Reassignment - greeting now points to a new string object
```

After reassignment, the variable points to the new object, and if there are no other references to the original object, Python's garbage collector may reclaim that memory. Stated alternatively: reassignment of a variable never mutates the value it contains, it just pointing to a new, different object.


### Variable Scope

A variable's scope is the region of code where that variable is valid and can be referenced. Scope can be Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. 

**Global Scope**

Variables defined outside any function have global scope and can be accessed throughout your program, including inside functions and classes, unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name.

```python

message = 'Global variable'  # Global variable

def some_function():
    print(message)  # Can access the global variable

some_function()  # Prints: Global variable
```

The use of globals are generally considered to be bad form and should be avoided. 

>Using the global statement generally takes away from the clarity of your code. It can create a number of issues, including the following:

> * Free variables, seemingly unrelated to anything
> * Functions without explicit arguments for said variables
> * Functions that can’t be used generically with other variables or arguments since they rely on a single global variable
> * Lack of thread safety when using global variables

(Chong, 2025)


**Local Scope**

Variables defined inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed within that function, and cannot be accessed or modified outside of that function. Local variables of one function are completely independent of local variables in another function, even if they have the same name.

```python
def another_function():
    local_var = 'Local variable'  # Local variable
    print(local_var)

another_function()  # Prints: Local variable
print(local_var)    # Error! local_var is not defined in this scope
```

Assignment statements in the local function cannot change variables defined outside the function.

**Important Scope Rule**

A function can access variables defined in the global scope without any special declaration, as long as it does not attempt to modify them. This is because the global variables are available to the local scope as read-only by default. While you can access global variables from inside functions, you cannot reassign them without using the `global` keyword:

```python
count = 10  # Global variable

def update_count():
    print(count)  # Can access global variable (prints: 10)
    # count = 20  # This would create a new local variable, not modify the global one
    global count  # This tells Python we want to modify the global variable
    count = 20    # Now this modifies the global variable

update_count()
print(count)  # Prints: 20
```

To review...

>Scope in Python is all about assignment statements. Assignment statements that update which object a variable points to. Scope is about variables and assignments; it's not about objects and mutation.

- Hunner (2025)

Scope in Python is fundamentally about variable names and where they can be accessed or assigned to. The statement by Hunner above, correctly emphasizes that scope concerns the ability to assign new values to variables (updating which object a variable points to) rather than the ability to mutate objects.

Variable scope determines where in your code a variable name can be accessed or reassigned. As explained in the Variable Scope assignment, Python has primarily global and local scopes that determine where variables can be accessed by name. When you create an assignment statement like `x = 5`, you're binding the name x to point to the object `5` in memory. The scope rules determine where this binding is valid. Scope restrictions apply specifically to reassignment operations. For example, if you try to reassign a global variable inside a function without using the global keyword, Python will create a new local variable instead.

In contrast, object mutation is not restricted by scope. You can mutate a global object from within a function without using the global keyword. This distinction is critical because it explains why we can modify global mutable objects from inside functions without the global keyword, but need global when we want to reassign those variables.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.pop()  # Mutation

print(a)  # [1, 2]
print(b)  # [1, 2]
```

This mutation affects both variables because they point to the same object, but scope isn't involved here at all - it's about object identity and mutation, not variable assignment.

Final Rules:

1.  Variables defined in a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed in the outer scope.
2.  Functions can access variables from outer scopes for reading. When attempting to reassign an outer scope variable within a function, Python creates a new local variable instead. However, if the outer scope variable references a mutable object (like a list or dictionary), the function can modify the contents of that object without creating a local variable, and these changes will persist outside the function.
3.  To modify a global variable within a function, you must declare it with the global keyword.
4.  Peer scopes do not conflict - variables in one function are not accessible in another function at the same level.

### Variables as References

In Python, **variables are references to objects, not containers for values**. This distinction is crucial.

```python
x = 5  # Creates an integer object with value 5 and points x to it
```

In memory, this looks something like: 

`Variable x → points to → Integer object with value 5.`

When you "change" an immutable object, you're actually creating a new object and redirecting the pointer. With mutable objects, you can modify the object itself, affecting all variables that point to it. However, reassignment creates a new pointer.

### Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

The concept of shallow copy and deep copy is directly connected to how Python handles variables as pointers (or object references). 

#### Shallow Copy

A shallow copy duplicates only the outermost container but share references to nested objects.


```python

import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
shallow_copied = copy.copy(original_list)  # Or original_list.copy() or list(original_list)

# Now we have two different lists
print(original_list is shallow_copied)  # False

# But they contain references to the same nested lists
print(original_list[0] is shallow_copied[0])  # True

# So modifying a nested element affects both lists
original_list[0][0] = 'changed'
print(shallow_copied[0][0])  # 'changed'
```

Common ways to create shallow copies:
* Using the `copy()` method: `new_list = original_list.copy()`
* Using the `list()` constructor: `new_list = list(original_list)`
* Using slicing: `new_list = original_list[:]`

#### Deep Copy

A deep copy creates a completely independent clone of the original object, including all nested objects.

```python


import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

# Two different outer lists
print(original_list is deep_copied)  # False

# Also two different nested lists
print(original_list[0] is deep_copied[0])  # False

# So modifying the original doesn't affect the copy
original_list[0][0] = 'changed'
print(deep_copied[0][0])  # Still 1
```

Here's a more realistic scenario showing why understanding this distinction matters:

```python
# Managing a student's courses and grades
student = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'courses': [
        {'name': 'Python', 'grade': 85},
        {'name': 'Databases', 'grade': 90}
    ]
}

# Make a copy to create a second student record
import copy
student2 = copy.copy(student)
student2['name'] = 'Bob'

# With shallow copy, both students now share the same courses list
student['courses'][0]['grade'] = 95
print(student2['courses'][0]['grade'])  # Also shows 95!

# Deep copy would have prevented this issue
student3 = copy.deepcopy(student)
student3['name'] = 'Charlie'
student['courses'][0]['grade'] = 100
print(student3['courses'][0]['grade'])  # Still 95
```

#### When to Use Each

* Use shallow copy​ when you need a new container but are fine with sharing the contained objects (and those objects are immutable or you don't plan to modify them).
*  ​Use deep copy​ when you need a completely independent duplicate, especially when working with nested mutable structures.

Python's optimization for immutable values means that even with deep copies, you might still share references to immutable objects like integers and strings - but this is generally safe since these objects can't be modified.

#### Why it Matters

Shallow and deep copying directly builds on the fundamental concept that variables in Python are references to objects in memory. When you make a copy, you're really creating new references (pointers) to either the same objects (shallow copy) or brand new duplicate objects (deep copy). The copying mechanism is fundamentally about how variables reference objects in memory.

Understanding shallow vs. deep copying is also important for '**Pass by Object Reference**' because when you pass mutable objects to functions, you're passing a reference, not a copy. This has similar implications to using shallow copies.​


#### Connecting Copy Operations to Parameter Passing in Python


Implications for Mutable vs. Immutable Objects

**Mutable Objects (lists, dictionaries, sets)**
1.  ​When passed to functions​: Changes to the object within the function will affect the original object
2.  ​With shallow copy​: The new container can be modified independently, but nested mutable objects are shared
3.  ​With deep copy​: Complete independence - changes to the copy won't affect the original at any level

**Immutable Objects (integers, strings, tuples)**
1.  ​When passed to functions​: Since they can't be modified, operations create new objects
2.  ​With both shallow and deep copy​: Practically identical for simple immutable objects due to Python's optimization

Key Takeaways
1.  ​Pass by object reference​ means you're passing a reference to the object, similar to a shallow copy
2.  ​Shallow copy​ creates a new container but shares references to the inner objects
3.  ​Deep copy​ creates new copies of all nested objects, ensuring complete independence
4.  Mutability is the key factor​ that determines whether modifications will affect the original object

### Variable Shadowing

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, effectively "hiding" the outer variable.  

Local variable can "shadow" a global variable if it has the same name. In this case, the local variable takes precedence within the function's scope.

```python
message = "Global message"  # Global variable

def greet():
    message = "Local message"  # Local variable shadows the global one
    print(message)  # Prints "Local message"

greet()
print(message)  # Prints "Global message" - global variable remains unchanged
```

In this example, the local message variable inside the `greet()` function shadows the global message variable. They are entirely separate variables that happen to share the same name. Further, this code demonstrates Python's variable scope rules, specifically highlighting how variables defined in the global scope cannot be reassigned within a function's local scope without using the global keyword.

Key Behaviors of Shadowing
1.  **​Separate Variables**​: The shadowing variable and the shadowed variable are completely separate - they exist in different scopes and refer to different objects in memory.
2. **No Modification**​: Shadowing does not modify the original variable - it simply hides it within the local scope.
3. **​Contrast with** `global`​: Shadowing is different from using the global keyword, which allows you to modify the global variable


**Nested Functions and Multiple Levels of Shadowing**

With nested functions, you can have multiple levels of shadowing

```python

x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "outer"  # Shadows global x
    
    def inner():
        x = "inner"  # Shadows outer's x
        print(f"inner x: {x}")
    
    inner()
    print(f"outer x: {x}")

outer()
print(f"global x: {x}")

#Output:

#inner x: inner
#outer x: outer
#global x: global
```

Unless mentioned specifically, the term variable in the broadest sense possible. On this exam, that means that all of the following should be treated as variables:

* Variables and constants
* Function names
* Function parameters
* Note in particular that dictionary key names are not variables, nor are the elements of a collection.

### Expressions and Statements

#### Expressions

An expression is any code that evaluates to a value. 

Key points to understand:
* ​Simple expressions​: Literals like `5`, `'hello'`, or `True`
* Variables​: Variable names like `my_var` evaluate to their current value
* ​Operators​: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical (`and`, `or`, `not`), identity (`is`, `is not`), and membership (`in`, `not in`)
* ​Function calls​: Calls like `len([1, 2, 3])` are expressions
* ​Method calls​: Things like `string.upper()`
* ​Compound expressions​: Combinations like `(x + y) * z`

#### Statements

Statements are complete lines of code that perform an action but don't necessarily produce a value. 

Important types:
* ​Assignment statements​: `x = 5`
* ​Compound assignment​: `x += 3`
* ​Function/method definitions​: `def my_func():`
* ​Control flow statements​: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`
* ​Import statements​: `import math`
* ​Return statements​: `return x`

### Functions

#### Function Definitions and Calls

**Function Definition**: A function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and a colon. The function body is indented below. Functions in Python create a new local scope.

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # function body
    return something
```

**Function Call**: To use a function, we "call" that function. When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses containing any argument.  If the function accepts arguments, pass the arguments inside the parentheses as you call the function.

```python
result = function_name(argument1, argument2)
```

#### Return Values

If a function has a return value, you can capture that return value into a variable or pass that return value straight into another function call. Functions in Python return values using the `return` statement. 

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

sum = add(5, 3)  # sum will be 8
```
If a function doesn't have a return statement or has return without a value, it returns `None` by default.

An example for how to describe the following code on the exam:

```python

hello = "Hello, world!"

def my_func():
    print(hello)

my_func()
```

The function outputs Hello, world!, which it obtains from the global variable hello, then returns None. Functions in Python have access to variables defined in the outer scope.

#### Parameters vs. Arguments

**Parameters** are the names assigned to a function's arguments. They are the variables listed in the function definition. They are essentially placeholders or variables that will receive values when the function is called.

```python
def multiply(x, y):  # x and y are parameters
    return x * y
```


**Arguments** are the actual values that get passed to the function. 

```python
product = multiply(4, 5)  # 4 and 5 are arguments
```

Remember: 

* Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments; arguments are the values that get passed to the function.
* Variables are not passed to or returned by functions -- only references to objects are passed.


**Nested functions** are functions defined inside other functions.

Key points about nested functions:

* Inner functions can access variables from the outer function's scope
* Inner functions are only accessible within the scope of the outer function
* They help with code organization and encapsulation


[Back to the top](#top)


### Output vs Return Values & Side Effects


**Return values** are data that functions give back to be used elsewhere in the program.

**Output** refers to displaying information (usually via `print()`), which is a _side effect_ - an action that affects something outside the function.

It's generally best practice to separate functions that return values from functions that have side effects:

>"You should avoid functions that print things and return a useful value... Those are two distinct actions that you may not always want to do together."


Additionally, function names should reflect whether they return values or produce side effects:

* Use names like `display_total`, `print_info`, or `show_results` for functions that output information
* Use names like `calculate_total`, `compute_sum`, or `get_average` for functions that return values

Exceptions to the Rule: there are valid exceptions to the "_don't mix return values and side effects_" rule:

* Functions that read user input (like Python's built-in input() function)
* Functions that interact with databases
* Functions that read/write from files

Make sure the functions are at consistent abstraction levels, where:

1.  Your code becomes more readable
2.  You can use functions without thinking about their implementation
3.  Your mental focus stays compartmentalized
4.  Large programs become easier to manage

Function names should be in the language of the problem domain (verbs that make sense in the context).  They should specify "what" to do, not "how" to do it

### Default Function Arguments: Mutable vs. Immutable Parameters

Default argument values in Python are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called.
Default function arguments in Python work differently depending on whether they are mutable or immutable objects. This means that if the default argument is a mutable object (like a list), changes to it will persist across function calls.

#### Immutable Default Arguments

When an immutable object (like a string, integer, or tuple) is used as a default argument, it behaves as you might expect:

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())        # "Hello, Guest!"
print(greet("Alex"))  # "Hello, Alex!"
```

Each function call that uses the default value gets a "fresh" reference to the immutable value. Since immutable objects can't be changed, there's no concern about maintaining state between function calls.

#### Mutable Default Arguments

The behavior changes dramatically with mutable default arguments:

```python
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

list1 = add_item(1)  # [1]
list2 = add_item(2)  # [1, 2]  - Not [2] as you might expect!

print(list1)  # [1, 2]
print(list2)  # [1, 2]
```

This behavior occurs because:
1.  The empty list `[]` is created once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called
2.  All calls to `add_item()` that use the default argument reference the same list object
3.  The `append()` method mutates this shared list object
4.  Both `list1 `and `list2` end up pointing to the same object

Once again, when a function has a mutable default argument, such as a list or a dictionary, that default argument is created once—at the time the function is defined—and persists across all subsequent calls to the function. 

Python passes object references to functions. With mutable objects, operations that mutate the object (like `append()`) will affect the original object.


#### The Proper Pattern

To avoid this unexpected shared state, the standard pattern is to use `None` as the default parameter and create a new mutable object inside the function:

```python
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []  # Create a fresh list each time
    items.append(item)
    return items

list1 = add_item(1)  # [1]
list2 = add_item(2)  # [2]

print(list1)  # [1]
print(list2)  # [2]
```

#### Why This Matters

This behavior can lead to subtle bugs that are hard to track down. Understanding this aspect of Python is important because:

1.  It demonstrates how Python handles objects differently based on mutability
2.  It shows how Python's function definition works (evaluating defaults once)
3.  It illustrates a common pitfall that experienced Python developers must avoid

## Numbers

**Integers `(int)`**

Integers in Python are whole numbers without a decimal point. They can be positive or negative and have unlimited precision.

```python

x = 42           # Positive integer
y = -10          # Negative integer
z = 1_000_000    # Large integer with underscores for readability (Doesn't work with strings to int)
```

Key points:

* Python 3 has no size limit for integers (unlike some other languages)
* You can use underscores to make large integers more readable (may cause)
* Integer division (`//`) produces another integer, rounding down


**Floating-Point Numbers `(float)`**

Floats represent real numbers with decimal points:

```python
pi = 3.14159
e = 2.718282
negative_float = -0.5
```

Important considerations:

* Floats have limited precision and can lead to rounding errors
* When you mix integers and floats in arithmetic operations, the result is always a float:
`result = 3 + 2.0  # result is 5.0 (float)`

Standard arithmetic operations may produce unexpected results due to binary floating-point representation:
` 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 #not exactly 0.3`


**Complex Numbers `(complex)`**
Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, where the imaginary part is written with a j suffix:

```python

z = 3 + 4j      # Complex number
real_part = z.real  # 3.0
imag_part = z.imag  # 4.0
```
You'll use complex numbers less frequently unless you're doing specialized mathematical or scientific computations.

Checking number types:

```python
type(42)         # <class 'int'>
type(3.14)       # <class 'float'>
type(1+2j)       # <class 'complex'>
```

## Strings!

### Basics on Strings

1. **​Definition and Creation**​: Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, created using single quotes (`'text'`), double quotes (`"text"`), or triple quotes for multi-line strings (`'''text'''` or `"""text"""`).

2. **​Immutability**​: Strings are immutable - once created, one cannot change individual characters. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.

3. **​Sequence Type**​: Strings are sequence types, meaning they:
* Have ordered elements (characters)
* Can be accessed by index
* Can be iterated over
* Support operations like membership testing with in

4. **​String Representation**​: Strings have literal representation in code and different display formats when printed (e.g., escape sequences like `\n` are interpreted when displayed).

5. **​Empty Strings**​: An empty string `''` or `""` is a valid string with length `0`, which evaluates to `False` in boolean contexts.

6. **​Memory Management**​: Due to immutability, Python can optimize memory by having multiple variables reference the same string object (especially for string literals).

7. **​Type Conversion**​: Other data types can be converted to strings using the `str() `function.

8. **​Concatenation and Repetition​:** Strings can be joined with `+` and repeated with `*` operators.

### f-strings and the `.format()` method

F-Strings, short for "Formatted String Literals", were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a concise, readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.

```python
name = "Victor"
profession = "programmer"
message = f"Hello, {name}. You are a {profession}."
```

Key Features:
* Start with `f` before the quotation marks
* Expressions in curly braces `{}` are evaluated at runtime
* Can include any valid Python expression inside the braces
* More readable and typically faster than other formatting methods

**Advanced F-string Techniques**:
```python

# Expression evaluation
price = 19.99
tax_rate = 0.07
print(f"Total price: ${price * (1 + tax_rate):.2f}")

# Using dictionary values
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old")

# Formatting options
pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
```

The `.format()` method was introduced before f-strings and provides similar functionality but with a different syntax.

```python
name = "Victor"
profession = "programmer"
message = "Hello, {}. You are a {}.".format(name, profession)
```

Key Features:
* Uses placeholders `{}` in the string
* Values are passed as arguments to the `.format()` method
* Arguments fill placeholders in order (unless specified otherwise)


**Advanced .format() Techniques**:
```python

# Indexed placeholders
print("{1} was born in {0}".format("New York", "Alice"))  # Alice was born in New York

# Named placeholders
print("Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.".format(name="Bob", age=25))

# Formatting options
print("Pi rounded to 3 decimal places: {pi:.3f}".format(pi=3.14159))
```

#### When to Use Each:

* F-strings are generally preferred in modern Python code due to their readability and performance
* The `.format()` method is still widely used, especially in older code
* Both methods support the same formatting options (precision, alignment, etc.)
* F-strings can directly use variables from the current scope, while `.format()` requires passing values explicitly

### String Methods

#### Case Modification Methods
 
* ​`.capitalize()`, `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.swapcase()`, `.title()`
* Work on empty strings without errors (return empty strings)
* Handle special characters by leaving them unchanged
* With non-alphabetic characters, they focus only on the letters 

`​.capitalize()​`: Converts the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase
`'hello world'.capitalize()  # 'Hello world'`

`​.swapcase()`​: Converts uppercase to lowercase and vice versa
`'Hello World'.swapcase()  # 'hELLO wORLD'`

`​.upper()`​: Converts all characters to uppercase
`'hello'.upper()  # 'HELLO'`

`​.lower()`​: Converts all characters to lowercase
`'HELLO'.lower()  # 'hello'`

`​.title()`​: Capitalizes the first letter of each word 
`'launch school tech & talk'.title()  # 'Launch School Tech & Talk'`

#### Character Testing Methods

* `​.isalpha()`, `.isdigit()`, `.isalnum()`, `.islower()`, `.isupper()`, `.isspace()`
* Return `False` for empty strings
* Particularly useful for input validation
* Be aware of Unicode characters:
    * `'²'.isdigit()` returns `True` (superscript is a digit)
    * `'héllò'.isalpha()` returns `True` (accented characters are alphabetic)

`​.isalpha()`​: Returns `True` if all characters are alphabetic (letters)
```python
'Hello'.isalpha()  # True
'Hello123'.isalpha()  # False
```

`​.isdigit()`​: Returns `True` if all characters are digits
```python
'12345'.isdigit()  # True
'123abc'.isdigit()  # False
```

`​.isalnum()`​: Returns `True` if all characters are alphanumeric (letters or digits)
```python
'Hello123'.isalnum()  # True
'Hello 123'.isalnum()  # False (space is not alphanumeric)
```

`​.islower()`​: Returns `True` if all characters are lowercase
```python
'hello'.islower()  # True
'Hello'.islower()  # False
```

`​.isupper(`)​: Returns `True` if all characters are uppercase
```python
'HELLO'.isupper()  # True
'Hello'.isupper()  # False
```

`​.isspace()`​: Returns `True` if all characters are whitespace
```python
'   '.isspace()  # True
'hello'.isspace()  # False
```

#### String Modification Methods

* `.strip()`, `.rstrip()`, `.lstrip()`
* Safe with empty strings (return empty strings)
* Without arguments, remove whitespace only
* With arguments, remove any character in the argument string

`​.strip()`​: Removes leading and trailing whitespace (or specified characters)
```python
'  hello  '.strip()  # 'hello'
'xxxhelloxxx'.strip('x')  # 'hello'
```

`​.rstrip()`​: Removes trailing whitespace (or specified characters)
`'  hello  '.rstrip()  # '  hello'`

`.lstrip()​`: Removes leading whitespace (or specified characters)
`'  hello  '.lstrip()  # 'hello  '`


`​.replace()`​: Replaces occurrences of a substring with another
`'Captain Ruby'.replace('Ruby', 'Python')  # 'Captain Python'`

* Works on empty strings without errors
* Replaces all occurrences unless limited by the count parameter
* Returns the original string if the substring to replace isn't found

#### Search and Split Methods

`​.split()`​: Splits string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter
```python
'hello world'.split()  # ['hello', 'world']
'hello,world,python'.split(',')  # ['hello', 'world', 'python']
```

* With no arguments, splits on whitespace and returns empty list for empty string
* Consecutive delimiters are treated as one delimiter by default
* Can specify maxsplit to limit number of splits

`​.find()`​: Returns the lowest index of the substring (or `-1` if not found)
```python
'hello world'.find('world')  # 6
'hello world'.find('python')  # -1
```

`​.rfind()`​: Like find but searches from the right (returns highest index)
`'hello world hello'.rfind('hello')  # 12`

Both `.find()` and `.rfind()`:

* Return -1 if substring not found (rather than raising an error)
* Empty string is always found at position 0 in non-empty strings
* Always return -1 when searching in empty strings*

#### `.join()` method

The `join()` method is a string method used to concatenate elements of an iterable (like a list or tuple) into a single string. It's an essential tool for string manipulation. The join method expects exactly one argument: the iterable whose elements you want to join. If you call it with fewer or more arguments, Python will raise a `TypeError`.

The join method is not just for strings, although its held in the strings warehouse if you will. Iterables of strings, file objects and generator objects can also be used by the join method. 

**Converting a List to a String with `join`**

`join` is called on a string (which serves as the separator) and takes an iterable (like a list) as its argument.

Basic syntax: ```separator_string.join(iterable)```

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
result = ', '.join(my_list)
print(result)  # Output: apple, banana, cherry
```

​The items in the list must be strings​. If your list contains non-string elements, you'll need to convert them to strings first:
```python
# python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Convert each number to a string
numbers_as_strings = [str(num) for num in numbers]
result = ', '.join(numbers_as_strings)
print(result)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Or in one line
result = ', '.join(str(num) for num in numbers)
```

#### Important to Remember

1.  Strings in Python are ​immutable​. Methods like `.capitalize(`) and `.replace(`) don't modify the original string - they return a new string.

2.  A common bug is forgetting to capture the return value:

``` python
word = "hello"
word.capitalize()  # This doesn't change 'word'
print(word)  # Still 'hello'
   
   # Correct way:
word = word.capitalize()
print(word)  # Now 'Hello'
```

3.  For searching substrings, you can also use the `in` operator:

``` python
"World" in "Hello, World!"  # True
Python" in "Hello, World!"  # False
```

Python's `in` operator is typically the most idiomatic way to check whether one string contains another string in Python.
Keep in mind that the `in` operator is very literal about it's containment checking. That means, case is significant with substring checks. [Substring Checking - Python morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/courses/jumpstart/conditions/jumpstart-substrings-in-python/) 

```python
# Demonstrating case sensitivity.

part = "python"
whole = "I enjoy writing Python code."
print(part in whole) # False
print(part.casefold() in whole.casefold()) #True

```

## Hashability

A **hash value** is essentially a numeric "fingerprint" of data. When Python needs to store or look up objects in dictionaries or sets, it uses this fingerprint instead of comparing entire objects.

```python
print(hash("hello"))  # Might output: 8768730738463847
print(hash("hello"))  # Will always output the same number for "hello"
```

#### How Hash Values Are Derived

1.  Python applies a mathematical algorithm to convert data of any size into a fixed-size number
2.  The algorithm ensures that:
    * The same input always produces the same hash value
    * Different inputs (usually) produce different hash values
    * The calculation is fast

Python's exact hashing algorithm is implementation-specific, but it's designed to distribute values evenly across the numeric range.

#### Practical Use Cases

The main reason hash values matter is for dictionary and set operations:
```python

# When you do this:
student_grades = {}
student_grades["Alice"] = 95
```

The, Python internally does the following:
1. Calculates hash(`"Alice"`)
2. Uses that number to determine where to store `95`
3. When retrieving, calculates hash(`"Alice"`) again to find the location

#### Why Some Objects Can't Be Dictionary Keys

Since dictionaries rely on hash values staying consistent, only immutable objects can be used as keys.

#### What Makes an Object Hashable

An object is hashable if:

1.  It has a `__hash__()` method that returns the same integer value throughout its lifetime
2.  It can be compared to other objects via an `__eq__()` method
3.  If `a == b` is True, then `hash(a) == hash(b)` must also be True

This means the hash value must remain constant for the object's entire lifetime, which is why hashable objects are typically immutable.

#### The Hash Function

The `hash()` built-in function:

```python
number = 42
print(hash(number))  # Returns an integer hash value
```

This function computes a fixed-size integer from an object of arbitrary size.

```python
# Same value always produces the same hash
print(hash("hello") == hash("hello"))  # True

# Different values produce different hashes (with rare collisions)
print(hash("hello") == hash("world"))  # False
```

[Back to the top](#top)


### Immutability and Hashability

Immutability is closely tied to hashability because:

```python
This tuple is immutable and hashable
t = (1, 2, 3)
print(hash(t))  # Works fine

# This list is mutable and not hashable
l = [1, 2, 3]
try:
    print(hash(l))
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # "unhashable type: 'list'"

```

If objects could change their values while maintaining the same hash, it would break hash table data structures. 

#### Hashable vs. Non-hashable Types

**Hashable Types (Immutable)**:
* Numbers (int, float, complex)
* Strings
* Bytes
* Tuples (if all elements are hashable)
* Frozen sets
* None
* Boolean values

**Non-hashable Types (Mutable)**:
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Byte arrays
* User-defined classes (by default are hashable, but become non-hashable if you implement __eq__ without __hash__)

#### Hash Tables in Python

Internally, dictionaries and sets use hash tables:
1.  When you add a key to a dictionary, Python:
    * Computes the key's hash value
    * Uses that value to determine where to store the key-value pair
    * When retrieving, it calculates the hash again to find the location
2. This allows for O(1) average-case complexity for lookups, rather than O(n) with lists, This makes lookups extremely fast because Python can jump directly to the right location rather than searching through everything.

#### Hash Collisions

Sometimes different objects can produce the same hash value:
```python
# These might have the same hash (though unlikely)
str1 = "ab"
str2 = "ba"

```

When this happens, Python's hash tables handle it through techniques like chaining (storing multiple items in the same bucket).

>"A hashable type is a type from which consistent hash values can be computed. A hash function takes an object and returns a hash value, which is used internally in a dictionary to store and retrieve values. Given two identical objects, the hash function must return the same value for both objects."

## Booleans, Booleans vs. Truthiness and None

### Boolean vs. Truthiness

#### Boolean Values:

* Python has two boolean values: `True` and `False` (note the capitalization)
* These are specific data types in Python that represent logical truth values
* Boolean values are the direct result of comparison operations (like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)

#### Truthiness

**Truthiness** refers to how Python evaluates values in a boolean context (like in an `if` statement).

Falsy values in Python include:

*   `False`
*   `None`
*   Zero values: `0`, `0.0`, `0j`
*   Empty strings: `''`
*   Empty collections: `[]` (empty list), `{}` (empty dict), `()` (empty tuple)
*   `set()` (empty set)
*   `range(0)` (empty range)

**All other values are considered truthy in Python**.

Verbalizing the following distinctions are very important!

*   When a _value evaluates as true_ in a boolean context, say that it "**evaluates to true**" or "**is truthy**"
*   When a _value evaluates as false_ in a boolean context, say that it "**evaluates to false**" or "**is falsy**".
*   Do NOT say a value "is True" or "is equal to True" unless it's literally the boolean value `True`.
*   Do NOT say a value "is False" or "is equal to False" unless it's literally `False`.

```python

name = get_name_from_user()
if name:  # Checks if name is truthy (not empty)
    print(f"Hi {name}")
else:
    print("you must enter your name!")
```

[Back to the top](#top)

### `None`

`None` is a special object in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value. 

Key Characteristics of `None`:

1.  ​**It's a singleton object**​: There's only one `None` object in Python.
2.  ​**Data type**​: `None` has its own data type called `NoneType`.
3.  **​Falsy value**​: `None` is considered falsy in boolean contexts.

```python
   if None:
       print("This won't print")
   else:
       print("None is falsy")  # This will print
```

4. **Default return value**​: Functions without an explicit return statement, return `None` by default.

```python
   def no_return():
       pass
   
   result = no_return()
   print(result)  # None

```

## Boolean Logic Gates, Logical Operators, and Short Circuit Evaluation

Boolean logic gates are fundamental components in digital electronics and computer systems that process Boolean values (`True` and `False`), which are typically represented as 1 and 0 in computing.

**Basic Logic Gates**

1.  ​AND Gate
* Returns `True` only when **both** inputs are `True`.
* In Python, this is represented by the `and` operator
```python
   result = True and True  # True
   result = True and False  # False
```

2. ​ OR Gate
* Returns `True` if **at least one** input is `True`
* In Python, this is the `or `operator
```python
   result = True or False  # True
   result = False or False  # False
```

3.  ​XOR Gate (Exclusive OR)
* XOR (exclusive or) is a binary operation that takes two operands and returns True if exactly one of the operands is truthy, but not both
* Python doesn't have a built-in XOR operator, but you can create one with a combination of other logical operators like `and` and `or`.


```python

   def xor(value1, value2):
    if (value1 and not value2) or (value2 and not value1):
        return True
    return False
```

[Back to the top](#top)


### Short-Circuit Evaluation

Python's logical operators use short-circuit evaluation. Short-circuiting occurs when Python stops evaluating an expression as soon as it knows what the final result will be. This is a performance optimization that also enables some useful programming patterns.

`and`: Different ways to verbalize `and`

* If the first operand is `False`, Python **doesn't evaluate the second operand** because the result **must be `False`**. 
* It returns the first falsy value it finds (or the last value if all are truthy). 

_Note that `and` returns the value of the operand, not that its `True` or `False`_. 

```python
# AND operator returns the first falsy value, or the last value if all are truthy
print(0 and 5)        # 0 (returns first falsy value)
print(5 and 0)        # 0 (returns first falsy value)
print(5 and 10)       # 10 (all truthy, so returns last value)
print("" and "hello") # "" (returns first falsy value - empty string)
```

`or`: Different ways to verbalize `or`

* If the first operand is `True`, Python **doesn't evaluate the second operand** because the result must be `True`. 
* `or` stops evaluating when it encounters the first truthy value. 
* If the first operand is truthy, it returns that value without evaluating the second. If the first operand is falsy, it returns the second operand (regardless of whether it's truthy or falsy). 

_Note that `or` returns the value of the operand, not that its `True` or `False`_.

```python
# OR operator returns the first truthy value, or the last value if all are falsy
print(0 or 5)         # 5 (returns first truthy value)
print(5 or 0)         # 5 (returns first truthy value)
print(0 or "")        # "" (all falsy, so returns last value)
print(5 or 10)        # 5 (returns first truthy value)
```

Unlike `and` and `or`, the `xor` function can't use short-circuit evaluation since it needs to evaluate both operands to determine the result.

`not`: The `not` operator in Python is a logical negation operator that inverts the truth value of an expression. However, unlike `and` and `or`, the `not` operator doesn't participate in short-circuit evaluation.  The not operator simply takes a single operand and returns the opposite boolean value. Stated officially: the `not` operator is a unary operator that takes a single operand and inverts its truth value, returning either `True` or `False`. **It negates whatever value it's applied to**. 

```python

print(not True)  # False
print(not False)  # True

value = 3
is_even = (value % 2 == 0)
print(is_even)     # False
print(not is_even) # True
```

**Why `not` Doesn't Short-Circuit**

Short-circuit evaluation occurs when an operator can determine the final result without evaluating all operands. Since the `not` operator only works with a single operand, there's nothing to short-circuit - it must always evaluate that one operand to determine the result.

**Contrast with `and` and `or`**

Unlike `not`, the `and` and `or` operators do perform short-circuit evaluation:
* `and` short-circuits when it encounters the first `False` value (left to right)
* `or` short-circuits when it encounters the first `True` value (left to right)

```python
print(False and len(None))  # False (doesn't raise TypeError)
print(True or len(None))    # True (doesn't raise TypeError)
```

In both cases, Python doesn't evaluate `len(None)` (which would cause an error) because it already knows the final result based on the first operand.


**Commit this to memory**: `and` and `or` don't return `True` or `False` - they return the actual values that determine the result:

```python
print(5 and 7)      # Outputs: 7 (last value since both are truthy)
print(0 and 'hello')  # Outputs: 0 (first falsy value)
print('' or 42)     # Outputs: 42 (first truthy value)
print(0 or '')      # Outputs: '' (last value since both are falsy)
```

Python's logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) are designed to return the actual operand values rather than simply `True` or `False` because:

1.  **​It's more versatile​**: This behavior allows for elegant patterns like default values and short-circuit evaluation.
2.  **​It preserves information**​: By returning the actual value instead of just a boolean, you retain the specific value that determined the result.
3.  **​It aligns with Python's truthiness concept**​: Any value in Python can be evaluated in a boolean context.


```python
# For the 'or' operator:
print("hello" or "world")  # Returns "hello" (the first truthy value)
print("" or "world")       # Returns "world" (since "" is falsy)

# For the 'and' operator:
print("hello" and "world") # Returns "world" (the last value since both are truthy)
print("" and "world")      # Returns "" (the first falsy value)
```

#### How `and` works 

|First Result|Second Result|Total Result|
|------------|-------------|------------|
|True        |True         |True        |
|True        |False        |False       |
|False       |N/A (not run)|False       |

#### How `or` works 

|First Result|Second Result|Total Result|
|------------|-------------|------------|
|True	     |N/A (not run)|True        |
|False	     |True	       |True        |
|False	     |False	       |False       |

#### Logical Operator Precedence:

In Python, the logical operators have different precedence levels:

1.  `not` (highest)
2.  `and`
3.  `or` (lowest)

For example, in the expression `not a and b or c`, Python would evaluate:
* First: `not a`
* Then: `(not a) and b`
* Finally: `((not a) and b) or c` #prints out `c`

## Operators

We've already covered Logical Operators right above. Now for the rest.

### Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, //, %, **

Basic Arithmetic Operators:

*   ​Addition (`+`)​: Adds two values
*   Subtraction (`-`)​: Subtracts the right operand from the left
*   Multiplication (`*`)​: Multiplies two values
*   ​Division (`/`)​: Divides the left operand by the right, always returns a float
*   Floor Division (`//`)​: Divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result
*   Modulo (`%`)​: Returns the remainder of division
*   Exponentiation (`**`)​: Raises left operand to the power of right operand


Operator Precedence in Arithmetic Expressions,  order from high to low:

1.  Parentheses `()`
2.  Exponentiation `**`
3.  Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Floor Division `//`, Modulo `%`
4.  Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`

According to the Python documentation on operator precedence, expressions like `4 * 5 + 3**2 / 10` are evaluated in this order:

1.  `3**2 = 9` (exponentiation first)
2.  `4 * 5 = 20` (multiplication)
3.  `9 / 10 = 0.9` (division)
4.  `20 + 0.9 = 20.9` (addition last)

For clarity, you can use parentheses: `(4 * 5) + ((3**2) / 10)`

#### Float vs Integer Division

In Python 3, the division operator / always performs floating-point division.
` 7 / 2  # Result: 3.5`

To get integer division (truncating decimal part), use floor division //:
`7 // 2  # Result: 3`. **_Note that it rounds down!_**

Whenever we mix integers and floating point numbers, we'll get a floating point number back. For most operations we might perform between two integers, we'll get an integer back. But if we divide two integers, we'll always get a floating point number back.


**Floating Point Arithmetic**

Be aware that floating-point calculations may have precision issues:
` 3.141529 - 2.718282  # Result: 0.42324699999999993`

How to handle floating point inaccuracies:

1.  Use the `math.isclose()` function: When comparing floating point numbers, avoid using the equality operator (`==`). Instead, use the `math.isclose() `function. The `math.isclose()` function checks if two values are close enough to be considered equal, taking into account the inherent imprecision of floating point arithmetic.

2.  Round to a specific precision:  When displaying results, round to a specific number of decimal places:
```python
result = 3.141529 - 2.718282  # equals 0.42324699999999993
print(round(result, 6))  # 0.423247
```

3. Use formatted string literals (f-strings): F-strings allow you to control how floating point numbers are displayed:
```python
result = 3.141529 - 2.718282
print(f"{result:.6f}")  # "0.423247"
```

4. Consider using the decimal module, for use in financial calculations or when precision is critical:

```python

from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Set precision
getcontext().prec = 28

# Use Decimal instead of float
result = Decimal('0.3') + Decimal('0.6')
print(result)  # Exactly 0.9
```

5. Be aware of special floating point values: Python has special floating point values, `nan` (Not a Number). Note that `nan` values have unique behavior.

```python
nan_value = float("nan")
print(nan_value == float("nan"))  # Returns False!
```

To check for `nan` values, `use math.isnan()`:

``` python
import math
nan_value = float("nan")
print(math.isnan(nan_value))  # Returns True
```

6. Handle division by zero: When performing division, be aware of potential `ZeroDivisionError`.

``` python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    result = "Error: Division by zero"
```

### String Concatenation with `+`

In Python, the `+` operator performs string concatenation when used with strings:

```python
str1 = "Hello, "
str2 = "world!"
result = str1 + str2  # "Hello, world!"
```

Key points about string concatenation:

1. The `+ `operator **creates a new string** when combining two strings
2. Both operands must be strings; otherwise, you'll get a `TypeError`.
3. String concatenation is inefficient for multiple operations. For better performance with multiple strings, use `.join()` or f-strings.

[Back to the top](#top)


### List Concatenation with `+`

The `+` operator also works with lists, merging two lists to create a new one:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = list1 + list2  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Important characteristics of list concatenation:

1. Like string concatenation, the + operator **creates a new list**
2. The original lists remain unchanged.
3. Both operands must be lists (or other sequence types). You can't combine different types, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. For a more memory-efficient alternative to repeatedly using `+` for list concatenation, you can use the `.extend()` method to modify a list in-place:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.extend(list2)  # Modifies list1 in-place
print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

#### Basic Comparison Operators

* ​Equal (`==`)​: Tests if two values are equal
* Not Equal (`!=`)​: Tests if two values are not equal
* ​Less Than (`<`)​: Tests if left value is less than right value
* ​Greater Than (`>`)​: Tests if left value is greater than right value
* Less Than or Equal (`<=`)​: Tests if left value is less than or equal to right value
* Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)​: Tests if left value is greater than or equal to right value

#### Comparing Different Types

* Numbers of different types (int, float) can be compared directly
* Strings are compared lexicographically (dictionary order)
* Different types (like strings and numbers) follow specific comparison rules
```python

# Comparing different numeric types
3 == 3.0      # True

# String comparison
"apple" < "banana"   # True (alphabetical order)
"apple" < "Apple"    # False (uppercase comes before lowercase in ASCII)

# Different types
"5" == 5      # False (string vs int)
```
#### Truthiness vs. Boolean Values

Remember the distinction between truthiness and actual boolean values:

```python

# These are not the same:
bool(0) == False    # True (0 converts to False)
0 == False          # False (0 is falsy and False is False, thus are different values)

bool("") == False   # True (empty string converts to False)
"" == False         # False (empty string is falsy and False are different values)
```

#### Chained Comparisons

Python allows comparison chaining:

```python
# This:
x > y > z

# Is equivalent to:
x > y and y > z
```

#### Identity vs. Equality

Don't confuse `==` (equality) with `is` (identity):

* `==` checks if values are equal
* `is` checks if two variables reference the same object

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

a == b  # True (same values)
a is b  # False (different objects)
a is c  # True (same object)
```

[Back to the top](#top)


### Identity Operators: `is` and `is not`

As stated above, the `is` and `is not` operators in Python are identity operators that compare memory locations, rather than the values themselves. The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory. Similarly, `is not` checks if two variables do NOT point to the same object.

Common Use Cases:

1. Checking for `None`: The most common and recommended use of it is for comparing with `None`.
```python
x = None
if x is None:  # Preferred over x == None
    print("x is None")
```

2. Distinguishing Between Identity and Equality: This example demonstrates the difference between `is` and `==`:
```python

empty_list_1 = []
empty_list_2 = []
print(empty_list_1 == empty_list_2)  # True - same values
print(empty_list_1 is empty_list_2)  # False - different objects
```

#### Object Interning

As stated earlier, Python often reuse memory addresses for certain immutable objects like small integers or short strings. This is called "interning" and is an implementation detail of Python for optimization.

To Review: What Objects Get Interned?

1.  **​Small Integers**​: Integers in the range -5 to 256 are interned by default.
2.  **​Short Strings**​: String literals without spaces or special characters may be interned.

```python 
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print(s1 is s2)  # True

# But with string creation at runtime:
s3 = "".join(["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"])
print(s1 is s3)  # Could be False
```

3.  ​Empty Immutable Collections​: Empty tuples and frozensets are typically interned.

Don't use `is` for value comparison:

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000
print(a is b)  # Could be False, despite what you might expect
print(a == b)  # Always True - correct way to compare values
```

#### Why is it important?

1.  **​Behavior of Identity Comparisons**​: When using the is operator, interned objects will return `True` even if they were created separately. However, with non-interned objects, the same comparison would return `False`. If `a = b` and both equal 42, they will be the same object when evaluated with `is`. However, if `a = b` and both `= 1000` they will not. This distinction is crucial when debugging or when you're relying on identit comparisons in your code.

2. **Memory Optimization**

To avoid later problems:

* Use `==` for value comparison
* Reserve `is` for identity checks, primarily with `None`
* Never rely on interning behavior for critical program logic

### Operator Precedence

As mentioned above, there's a hierarchy. Here's the final boss hierarchy, from highest precedence to lowest:

1.  Parentheses `()`
2.  Exponentiation `**`
3.  Unary operators (+x, -x, ~x)
4.  Multiplication/Division (`*`, `/`, `//`, `%`)
5.  Addition/Subtraction (`+`, `-`)
6.  Comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==,` `!=`)
7.  Boolean `not`
8.  Boolean `and`
9.  Boolean `or`

Python first evaluates the function calls left-to-right, then applies operator precedence rules. All values are determined before any operations are performed.

## Type Coercions: explicit (e.g., using int(), str()) and implicit

There are two main types of type coercion in Python:

1.  ​**Explicit type coercion** ​: When you intentionally convert one data type to another using built-in functions
2.  **Implicit type coercion**​: When Python automatically converts one data type to another

#### Explicit Type Coercion

This happens when you deliberately use conversion functions:

```python

# String to integer
age_str = "25"
age_num = int(age_str)  # 25 (integer)

# Integer to string
count = 42
count_str = str(count)  # "42" (string)

# String to float
price_str = "19.99"
price_num = float(price_str)  # 19.99 (float)

# Integer/float to boolean
zero_bool = bool(0)  # False
nonzero_bool = bool(42)  # True
```

Common explicit conversion functions:

* `int()` - Converts to integer
* `float()` - Converts to floating-point
* `str()` - Converts to string
* `bool()` - Converts to boolean
* `list()` - Converts to list
* `tuple()` - Converts to tuple
* `set()` - Converts to set
* `dict()` - Converts to dictionary

#### Implicit Type Coercion

Python performs some automatic conversions:

```python

# Integer + Float = Float
result = 5 + 3.14  # 8.14 (float)

# Boolean in arithmetic operations
total = 10 + True  # 11 (True is treated as 1)
value = 5 * False   # 0 (False is treated as 0)
difference = 10 - False  # 10 (False is treated as 0)

#String Interpolation
name = "Nancy"
age = 30 
message = f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}"  # Values converted to strings
```

Boolean values are implicitly converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) in arithmetic operations. When using f-strings, Python implicitly converts values to strings.


#### Important Non-Coercion Cases

Some operations that look like implicit coercion aren't actually considered coercion:

1.  ​The `print()` function​: While `print()` does display non-string values, this conversion happens behind the scenes and isn't considered true coercion.
`print("Age:", 30)  # Outputs: Age: 30`

2.  ​String Concatenation​: Python does NOT implicitly convert integers to strings for concatenation - this requires explicit conversion.
```python
name = "Clare"
age = 35
print(name + age)  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

# Correct approach:
print(name + str(age))  # Works with explicit conversion
```

3. Numeric Strings in Calculations: Also requires explicit conversion.
```python
num_str = "10"
result = num_str + 5  # TypeError

# Correct approach:
result = int(num_str) + 5  # Works with explicit conversion
```

4. Container Type Conversion: Requires explicit conversion.
```python

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = my_list  # This assigns, doesn't convert

# Correct approach:
my_dict = dict(enumerate(my_list))  # Explicit conversion needed
```

### Allowed Conversions

**String Conversions**
* String to int: `int("42")` ✓
* String to float: `float("3.14")` ✓
* Any type to string: `str(42)`, `str(3.14)`, `str(True)`, `str([1,2,3])` ✓

**Numeric Conversions**
* Float to int: `int(3.14)` ✓ (truncates decimal part)
* Int to float: `float(42)` ✓
* Boolean to int/float: `int(True) (1)`, `float(False) (0.0)` ✓

**Collection Conversions**
* String to list: `list("hello")` ✓ (creates `['h','e','l','l','o']`)
* List to tuple: `tuple([1,2,3])` ✓
* Tuple to list: `list((1,2,3))` ✓
* List or tuple to set: `set([1,2,2,3])` ✓

**Boolean Conversions**
* Empty strings/collections to boolean: `bool("")`, `bool([])`, `bool({})` all convert to `False` ✓
* Zero to boolean: `bool(0)` converts to `False` ✓
* Any non-zero number to boolean: `bool(42`), `bool(-1)` convert to `True` ✓
* None to boolean: `bool(None)` converts to `False` ✓

#### Special Numeric Conversions

Special Cases are a doozy and there's a lot of them.

1.  ​NaN (Not a Number)
   * Created with `float('nan')`
   * NaN doesn't equal anything (including itself): `float('nan') == float('nan'`) returns `False`
   * Test for NaN using `math.isnan()`
   * Any arithmetic with `NaN` results in `NaN`

2.  ​Infinity
   * Created with `float('inf')` or `-float('inf')`
   * Valid in comparisons: `float('inf') > 999999999` is `True`
   * Arithmetic operations work as expected with infinity

3.  ​Underscores in Numeric Literals
   * Python allows `1_000_000` for readability
   * Converting strings with underscores will fail: `int('1_000_000')` raises `ValueError`

**String Conversion Special Cases**

1.  ​Number Base Conversions
* `int('101', 2)` converts binary '101' to decimal 5
* `int('FF', 16)` converts hex 'FF' to decimal 255
*  Base must be between 0 and 36

2.  ​Whitespace in Strings
* `int(' 42 ')` works (strips whitespace)
* `int('42 59')` raises `ValueError` (no spaces allowed between digits)

**Boolean Conversion Details**

1.  ​Complex Boolean Conversions
* Empty collections are falsy: `bool([])`, `bool({})`, `bool(())`, `bool(set())` are all `False`
* Non-empty collections are truthy, even with falsy elements: `bool([0, ''])` is `True`
* Custom classes are truthy by default unless `__bool__` or `__len__` is defined

2.  ​Boolean to Number
* `True == 1` and `False == 0` in arithmetic contexts
* `3 + True` equals `4`
* `True * 7` equals `7`

**Container Type Conversions**

1.  ​Dictionary Conversions
* `dict([('a', 1), ('b', 2)])` creates a dictionary from pairs
* `dict(a=1, b=2)` uses keyword arguments
* `dict(zip(['a', 'b'], [1, 2]))` combines two iterables

2.  ​Set Conversions
* `set('hello')` creates a set with unique letters: `{'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}`
* `set()` creates an empty set (not {}, which creates an empty dict)


#### More on Booleans are treated in arithmetic

In Python, boolean values undergo implicit type coercion in arithmetic operations:

* `True` is treated as the integer `1`
* `False `is treated as the integer `0`

Also:

* Boolean arithmetic is different from boolean equality
* `True == 1` evaluates to `True` but `True is 1` evaluates to `False`

```python
# Counting true values in a list
has_passed = [True, False, True, True, False]
total_passed = sum(has_passed)  # 3

# Conditional incrementing
count = 0
value = 25
count += (value > 20)  # Adds 1 if condition is True
```

#### Basic Pattern for Safe Type Conversion

```python
try:
    # Attempt the conversion
    converted_value = target_type(original_value)
    # Code that uses the converted value
except ExceptionType:
    # Handle the specific error
    # Could be ValueError, TypeError, etc.
```

#### Error Cases to Watch For

Python will raise exceptions for invalid conversions, namely in `ValueError` and `TypeError`:

`ValueError`:   When the value is the right type but inappropriate
```python
# ValueError - when the conversion cannot be performed
int("hello")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10
float("abc")  #(ValueError: could not convert string to float)

try:
    num = int("abc")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
except ValueError:
       print("Please enter a valid number.")
```


`TypeError`: When passing the wrong type to a conversion function.

```python
int(["42"])  # TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number
float({"value": 42}) #TypeError: float() argument must be a string or number

try:
    num = int(["42"])  # TypeError: int() argument must be a string or number
except TypeError:
    print("Invalid input type for conversion.")
```

#### Try/Except Error Handling, briefly. More later.

A robust example:

```python

try:
    num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = int(num_str)
    result = 10 / num
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    print("Exception handling complete.")
```

### Practical Applications of Type Coercion in Python

The folowing are real programming scenarios you'll encounter:

#### User Input Processing

One of the most common applications is handling user input.

```python
age_str = input("Enter your age: ")  # Returns a string
age = int(age_str)  # Explicit coercion to integer for calculations

# With error handling
try:
    age = int(age_str)
    years_until_retirement = 65 - age
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
```

#### Arithmetic Operations

Type coercion is essential when performing calculations:

```python
# Implicit coercion: int to float
price = 10
tax_rate = 0.07
total = price * (1 + tax_rate)  # 10.7 (float)

# Explicit coercion for division
num_items = 10
num_people = 3
items_per_person = num_items // num_people  # Integer division
```

#### Building Strings for Output

When creating output for users:

```python
name = "Kelley"
score = 95
message = "Congratulations " + name + "! Your score is " + str(score)

# Better approach with f-strings
message = f"Congratulations {name}! Your score is {score}"
```

#### Validation Logic

Type coercion is key in validation functions:

```python
def is_valid_number(number_str):
    try:
        float(number_str)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
```

#### Truthiness in Conditional Statements

Using type coercion to boolean in if statements:

```python
# Empty collections are falsy
user_input = ""
if not user_input:
    print("You must enter a value")

# Check if a list has elements
items = []
if items:  # Coerced to False when empty
    print("Processing items...")
else:
    print("No items to process")
```

#### Data Processing

When working with data in different formats:

```python
# Converting collection types
data_tuples = [(1, "one"), (2, "two")]
data_dict = dict(data_tuples)  # {1: "one", 2: "two"}

# Converting numerical data for display
temperatures = [22.5, 19.8, 25.1, 23.4]
temperatures_str = [f"{temp:.1f}°C" for temp in temperatures]
```

## Ranges

A range is a built-in sequence type in Python that represents an immutable sequence of numbers, typically used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.

#### Creating Ranges

The `range()` function can be called in three different ways:
1.  `​range(stop)`​: Creates a sequence from 0 to stop-1
    `range(5)  # Represents the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`
2. `range(start, stop)`​: Creates a sequence from start to stop-1
    `range(2, 7)  # Represents the sequence 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`
3. `range(start, stop, step)`​: Creates a sequence from start to stop-1, incrementing by  step. 
```python
range(1, 10, 2)  # Represents the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
range(10, 0, -1)  # Represents the sequence 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

Key properties of ranges:

* **Ranges are ​immutable**: you cannot modify them after creation
* **Ranges are ​memory efficient**​: they don't store all values in memory, just start, stop, and step.
* **Ranges are ​lazy evaluated**​: values are generated on demand

#### Common Operations with Ranges

1.  ​Iterating with a for loop​:
```python
for num in range(5):
       print(num)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

2. ​Converting to other sequence types​:
```python
list(range(3, 8))  # [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
tuple(range(3, 8))  # (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
```

3. Checking membership:
```python
5 in range(1, 10)  # True
11 in range(1, 10)  # False
```

4.  ​Getting length​:
`len(range(5, 20, 3))  # 5 (represents 5, 8, 11, 14, 17)`

5.  ​Indexing and slicing​:
```python
r = range(0, 10)
r[3]  # 3
r[-1]  # 9
r[2:5]  # range(2, 5)
```

#### Common use cases

1. Counting loops:
```python
for i in range(5):
       print(f"Count: {i}")
```

2.  ​Working with list indices​:
```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    print(f"Index {i}: {my_list[i]}")
```

3. Generating number sequences​:
```even_numbers = list(range(0, 11, 2))  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]```


Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy where expressions are not evaluated until their values are actually needed. In Python, this concept appears in several contexts, particularly with ranges. When you create a range in Python, it doesn't immediately compute all the values in that sequence. Instead, it stores only the start, stop, and step parameters and generates values on-demand when you iterate through it or access specific elements.

For example: `r = range(1, 1000000)`. This line doesn't create a list with 999,999 numbers. It just creates a range object that knows how to generate those numbers when needed. This is memory-efficient compared to creating the equivalent list: `huge_list = list(range(1, 1000000))`.

Beyond ranges, Python uses lazy evaluation in other contexts:
1.  ​Generators​: Similar to ranges, generators produce items only when needed.
2.  ​Short-circuit evaluation​: With logical operators and and or, Python only evaluates as much as necessary to determine the result.

### Range Boundaries Explained

When you create a range with `range(start, stop)`, it includes:
* The `start` value (inclusive)
* All values up to but NOT including the `stop` value (exclusive)

This behavior is consistent across all range creation patterns:
```python
range(5)         # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (no 5)
range(2, 7)      # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (no 7)
range(1, 10, 2)  # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (no 10)
```

#### Why This Design Choice?

This "up to but not including" behavior may seem odd at first, but it offers several advantages:

1.  **​Zero-indexing compatibility**​: Since Python uses zero-indexing for sequences, ranges align well with list indices.
2.  **​Length calculation**​: The length of a range is simply `stop - start` (when step is 1).
3.  **​Consecutive ranges**​: Ranges can be concatenated without overlapping

```python
 # These two ranges connect perfectly:
range(0, 5)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(5, 10) # 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

4. **Empty ranges**​: Easy to represent an empty range by setting start equal to stop.
` range(5, 5)  # Empty range`


#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

When working with ranges, watch out for these common errors:

1.  ​Assuming the stop value is included​:
```python
# If you need numbers 1-5 inclusive:
range(1, 6)  # Correct: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
range(1, 5)  # Incorrect: missing 5
```

2.  ​Off-by-one errors in loops​:
```python
 # To iterate through a list:
   my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
   for i in range(len(my_list)):  # range(3) is 0, 1, 2
       print(my_list[i])
```

3. Using Negative Steps: With negative steps, the range still excludes the stop value:
`range(10, 0, -1)  # 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (no 0)`


#### Understanding the Difference Between range(5) and list(range(5))

The key differencesare in their type, memory usage, and behavior:

**Type Difference**
* `range(5)` creates a range object, which is a specific sequence type in Python
* `list(range(5))` converts the range object into a list type, creating `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

**Memory Usage**
* `range(5)` is memory-efficient because it only stores the start (0), stop (5), and step (1) values
* `list(range(5))` stores all elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] in memory at once

**Lazy Evaluation**
* `range(5)` is lazily evaluated - it generates values on demand when you iterate through it
* `list(range(5))` eagerly evaluates all values immediately when created

**Mutability**
* `range(5)` is immutable - you cannot modify it after creation
* `list(range(5))` is mutable - you can add, remove, or change elements

```python
r = range(5)
print(type(r))          # <class 'range'>
print(r)                # range(0, 5)
print(3 in r)           # True (efficiently checked)

l = list(range(5))
print(type(l))          # <class 'list'>
print(l)                # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
l.append(5)             # Can modify lists
print(l)                # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Conditionals and Loops

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow your code to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are `True` or `False`. In Python, the main conditional statements are:

```python
# Basic if statement
if condition:
    # code executed if condition is True
    # The code inside the if block only executes when the condition evaluates to a truthy value.

# if-else statement
if condition:
    # code executed if condition is True
else:
    # code executed if condition is False

# if-elif-else statement (for multiple conditions)
if condition1:
    # code executed if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code executed if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # code executed if all conditions are False
```

For multiple `if/elif/else` conditions, they are evaluated in order, and only the first truthy condition's block will execute. If no condition is truthy, the `else` block executes.

Truthiness ALERT! This means you can use expressions directly in conditions without explicitly comparing them to `True` or `False`:

```python
name = "John"
if name:  # name is truthy because it's a non-empty string
    print(f"Hi {name}")
```

As always 'truthy' does not mean 'equal to `True`.

As of 3.10 there's also **match case statements**.

```python

animal = 'horse'
match animal:
    case 'dog':
        print('woof')
    case 'cat':
        print('meow')
    case 'horse':
        print('neigh')  # This will be printed
    case _:  # Default case. #Always use a default case!
        print('unknown animal')
```

Use match-case when:

1.  You're comparing a single value against multiple possible patterns
2.  Your code has multiple if-elif-else statements checking the same variable
3.  You want to improve readability for value-based branching logic

Remember that once a matching case is found, the associated block executes and then the program exits the match statement entirely. Only one case block will execute per match statement. Therefore, always have a default case (`case _:`) ready to catch unmatched pairs. Also, place more specific patterns before more general ones. This is especially important when using pattern matching with more complex structures.

### Loops

Loops allow you to execute the same block of code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops: `for` and `while`.

`for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects:

```python
# Iterating over a list
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Using range() to iterate a specific number of times
for i in range(5):  # Generates numbers 0 through 4
    print(i)
```

#### `for` Loops Best Practices

1.  ​Use descriptive variable names in your loop​.
2.  ​Prefer `for` loops when the number of iterations is known.
3.  ​Use `enumerate()` when you need both index and value​.
4.  ​Use list comprehensions for simple transformations

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [num**2 for num in numbers]
```

A note of syntax from [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/courses/jumpstart/tuple-unpacking-and-slicing/tuple-unpacking/):

>Every iteration of a for loop does an implicit assignment. The thing _between _ the **for** and the **in** in a `for` loop, is very similar to the thing on the left-hand side of an equal sign in an assignment statement.


`while` loops continue executing as long as a condition remains True. There are two main ways to use `while` loops:

1.  ​Standard `while` loop​ - Tests a condition before each iteration:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Don't forget this or you'll have an infinite loop!
```

2. `​while True` with `break`​ - A more flexible approach when you need more complex exit conditions:
```python
while True:
    print('Continue? (y/n)')
    answer = input()
    if answer.lower() == 'n':
        break
```

#### `while` loop best practices

1. ​Choose between regular `while` and `while True` appropriately​.
2. ​Always include a way to exit the loop​, so as to avoid infinite loops.
3. Use `break` to exit early when appropriate.


#### Loop control statements

* `break`: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the loop condition. Useful in a `while` loop. 
* `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one
* `pass`: Does nothing, acts as a placeholder. It does nothing but can be useful when you need a statement syntactically but don't want any action.


#### Nested Loops and Loop Control

Loop control statements affect only the innermost loop they are placed in:

```python

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 1:
            break  # This only breaks out of the inner loop
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

#### When to Use Each Control Statement

* Use `break` when you want to exit a loop completely (example: found what you're looking for)
* Use `continue` when you want to skip specific iterations but continue the loop
* Use `pass` when you need a placeholder or an empty block syntactically

Lots of times either loop will do, but it requires careful syntaxing:

```python
# Using a for loop
fish = ['Dory', 'Marlin', 'Gill', 'Nemo', 'Bruce']
for fish_name in fish:
    if fish_name == 'Nemo':
        print('Found Nemo!')
        break

# Using a while loop (alternative approach)
index = 0
while index < len(fish):
    if fish[index] == 'Nemo':
        print('Found Nemo!')
        break
    index += 1
```

### Ternary Operator

Python's conditional expression (often called the ternary operator) provides a concise way to write simple `if-else` statements in a single line. It follows this syntax: **`true_value if condition else false_value`**.

#### Basic Usage

The ternary operator evaluates the condition and returns either the first value (if the condition is truthy) or the second value (if the condition is falsy):

```python
# Traditional if-else
if age >= 18:
    status = "adult"
else:
    status = "minor"

# Ternary equivalent
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"

# Another, longer example

# Traditional if/else
if idx % 2 == 0:
    number = '1'
else:
    number = '0'

# Equivalent ternary
number = '1' if idx % 2 == 0 else '0'
```

```python
# Simple string formatting
greeting = "Hello, " + (name if name else "Guest")

# Default values
username = user_input if user_input else "Anonymous"

# Quick math
absolute_value = x if x >= 0 else -x

# Choosing between functions
action = save_data if is_valid else show_error
```

The ternary operator is best used when:
* The condition is simple
* Both outcomes are simple expressions (not complex blocks of code)
* You need to assign a value based on a condition

## Lists and Dictionaries

### Lists 

Lists in Python are **ordered**, **mutable** collections that can store elements of different data types. They are defined using square brackets `[]`. Because lists are mutable, you can change their content without creating a new list. Lists in Python don't actually contain objects, but references to objects.


```python
# Creating a list
empty_list = []
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]
nested_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]
```

#### List Indexing and Slicing

Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first element is at index `0`.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
print(my_list[0])      # 'a'
print(my_list[3])      # 'd'
print(my_list[-1])     # 'e' (negative indices count from the end)
print(my_list[-2])     # 'd'

# Slicing: my_list[start:end:step]
print(my_list[1:4])    # ['b', 'c', 'd'] (end index is exclusive)
print(my_list[:3])     # ['a', 'b', 'c'] (omitting start means from beginning)
print(my_list[2:])     # ['c', 'd', 'e'] (omitting end means to the end)
print(my_list[::2])    # ['a', 'c', 'e'] (step of 2)
print(my_list[::-1])   # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'] (negative step reverses)
```

With Python's slicing syntax, the first item is the start index, and the second item is the stop index. The start index is inclusive, but the stop index is exclusive, meaning Python stops just before the stop index. You may be wondering, why is the start index included, but the stop index is excluded? The exclusivity of the stop index actually has a nice side effect: if you slice up to index 3 and then start slicing again from 3 onward, those two slices won't overlap.

Additionally: Indexing out-of-bounds will raise an exception. But slicing past the end of a list doesn't raise an exception.

If an object is indexable, its sliceable.

-- from [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/courses/jumpstart/tuple-unpacking-and-slicing/slicing/)

#### List Methods

**Adding Elements**
* `append(item)`: Adds a single element to the end of the list. This method modifies the list in-place and returns `None`.
* `extend(iterable)`: Adds multiple elements from an iterable (like another list) to the end. Returns `None`.
* `insert(index, item)`: Inserts an item at a specific index position. If the index is out of range, it simply appends to the end. Returns `None`

**Removing Elements**
* `pop([index])`: Removes and returns the item at the given index. If no index, it removes the last item.
* `remove(item)`: Removes the **first occurrence** of the specified value, raising a `ValueError` if the item isn't found. Returns `None`.
* `clear()`: removes all items from the list. Returns `None`.

**Finding Elements**
* `index(item[, start[, end]])`: Returns the index of the **first occurrence** of the given item, raising a `ValueError` if the item isn't found.
* `count(item)`: Returns the number of occurrences of the specified item.

**Ordering Elements**
*   `reverse()`: Reverses the elements in-place, mutating the object. Returns `None`.  Use when you want to modify the list. Only works on lists!!!
*   `sort([key=None, reverse=False])`: Sorts the list in-place, optionally using a key function and/or in reverse order. Returns `None`

```python

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# Sort in reverse order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # [9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]

# Sort by length of string
words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pear"]
words.sort(key=len)
print(words)  # ["kiwi", "pear", "apple", "banana"]
```

**Copying**
* `copy()`:  Creates a shallow copy of the list. Note that nested objects are not deeply copied, just referenced. Returns the shallow copy!

**Other _built-in functions_ that work with lists**
* `len(list)`: Returns the number of items in the list.
* `sum()`: returns the sum of all items in a list (numbers only)
* `max()`:  returns the largest item in a list
* `min()`:  returns the smallest item in a list
* `sorted()`:  returns a new sorted list (unlike list.sort() which sorts in-place)
* `reversed(list)`: Creates an iterator that produces the elements in reverse order, 
returning a reverse iterator object, not a list. Preserves the original list.


**List Operators**
```python
# Concatenation
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [3, 4]
combined = list1 + list2  # [1, 2, 3, 4] Note: + creates a new list!!!

# Repetition
repeated = list1 * 3      # [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

# Membership
print(2 in list1)         # True
print(5 in list1)         # False

# Length
print(len(combined))      # 4
```


### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

```python
# Basic list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# With conditional
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]  # [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries in Python are **unordered collections of key-value pairs**, they map keys to values.  They're defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons. Dictionaries are meant to make it easy to look up the value that corresponds to a particular key.


#### Dictionary Characteristics

1. **​Keys must be immutable**​:

* Allowed keys: strings, numbers, tuples (containing only immutable elements), and frozensets
* Not allowed: lists, sets, dictionaries (mutable objects)
* Dictionary keys must be hashable, not just immutable. Hashability means the object has a hash value that doesn't change during its lifetime (which is why immutability is a prerequisite for hashability). Dictionary keys must be hashable because dictionaries use a hash table implementation internally for efficient lookups
* When you use a mutable object as a key you get a `TypeError`.

```python
my_dict = {}
my_dict[[1, 2, 3]] = "value"  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```


2. **​Values can be any type**​: Strings, numbers, lists, other dictionaries, functions, etc.

3.  **Order**:

* ​Unordered​ before Python 3.7. Now: dictionaries maintain insertion order
* Don't rely on order for the assessment

4. You can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs after creation.

#### Methods of creating a dictionary

1. Using Curly Braces (Dictionary Literal). Standard!
```python
# Dictionary with initial key-value pairs
empty_dict = {}  # Empty dictionary

car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'mileage': 80_000,
}
```
2.  Using the `dict()` Constructor
```python
# Empty dictionary
empty_dict = dict()

# From keyword arguments
person = dict(name='Alice', age=25, city='Portland')

# From a sequence of key-value pairs (tuples)
items = [('type', 'sedan'), ('color', 'blue'), ('mileage', 80_000)]
car = dict(items)
```

`dict()` requires the following to work:

* An iterable of key-value pairs like [('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')]
* Keyword arguments like dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')

3.  Dictionary Comprehensions: For creating dictionaries based on existing data.

```python
# Create a dictionary of numbers and their squares
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
# Result: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# Dictionary from two lists
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
letter_dict = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
# Result: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

#### Accessing values in dictionaries


1. **Using Square Bracket Notation**: The most common way to access dictionary values is using square brackets with the key

* If the key doesn't exist, Python will raise a `KeyError`.
* Case sensitivity matters - keys must match exactly.

```python
car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'year': 2003,
}

print(car['color'])  # Outputs: blue
```

2. **Using the `get()` method**: the preferred approach when you're not sure if a key exists in the dictionary.
```python
# Returns the value if key exists
print(car.get('color'))  # blue

# Returns None if key doesn't exist (no error)
print(car.get('model'))  # None

# Returns a default value if the key doesn't exist
print(car.get('model', 'Unknown'))
```

3. **Checking if a Key Exists**: Before accessing a value, you can check if a key exists using the in operator.
```python 
student = {
    'id': 123,
    'grade': 'B',
}

print('name' in student)      # False
print('grade' in student)     # True

# Using it in an if statement
if 'grade' in student:
    print(student['grade'])
else:
    print("Unknown")
```

4. Accessing Values in Nested Dictionaries: for nested dictionaries, chain the square brackets.

Additionally, `get()` with nested dictionaries approach is particularly useful as it won't raise an error if any level of the nested structure is missing.

```python
vehicles = {
    'car': {
        'type': 'sedan',
        'color': 'blue',
        'year': 2003,
    },
    'truck': {
        'type': 'pickup',
        'color': 'red',
        'year': 1998,
    },
}

# Access a value in a nested dictionary
print(vehicles['car']['color'])  # blue

# Using get() with nested dictionaries
print(vehicles.get('car', {}).get('color', 'Unknown'))  # blue
```

**A table for easier viewing, with extra defaults**

| Option                                 | Use case                                             |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `key in my_dict`                       | Check whether a key is in the dictionary             |
| `my_dict.get(key, default)`            | Get the value or a default just once                 |
| `my_dict.setdefault(key, default)`     | Set the value if it's not yet set                    |
| `my_dict = dict.fromkeys(keys, default)`| Construct dictionary with known keys, defaulting values|
| `my_dict = {key: [] for key in keys}`  | Construct dictionary with mutable values for defaults|
| `my_dict = Counter(items)`             | Create mapping meant just for counting occurrences   |
| `my_dict = defaultdict(list)`          | Create mapping with a default for all key lookups    |

#### Modifying Dictionaries

1. **Adding or Updating Key-Value Pairs**: The simplest way to modify a dictionary is by assigning a value to a key. If the key doesn't exist, Python adds a new key-value pair; if it does exist, Python updates the value.
```python

car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'mileage': 80_000,
}

# Adding a new key-value pair
car['year'] = 2003

# Updating an existing value
car['color'] = 'red'

print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'red', 'mileage': 80_000, 'year': 2003}
```

2. **Using the `update()` method:** lets you add or update multiple key-value pairs at once
```python

car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
}

# Adding/updating multiple key-value pairs
car.update({'year': 2003, 'mileage': 80_000, 'color': 'green'})

print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'green', 'year': 2003, 'mileage': 80_000}
```

#### Removing from dictionaries

1.  The `del` Statement: directly removes a key-value pair from a dictionary, mutating the dictionary object. It raises a `KeyError` if a key doesn't exist. No value is returned.
```python
car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'mileage': 80_000,
    'year': 2003,
}

del car['mileage']
print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'blue', 'year': 2003}
```

2. **The `pop()` method**:  removes a key-value pair and returns the value associated with the removed key. It will accept a default value as a second argument to return if the key doesn't exist, however if a key nor a default does not exist, it will raise a `KeyError`. This is a useful method when you know what you are removing.
```python

car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'mileage': 80_000,
    'year': 2003,
}

mileage = car.pop('mileage')  # mileage = 80_000
print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'blue', 'year': 2003}

#Example with a default value.
model = car.pop('model', 'not specified')  # model = 'not specified'
```

3. **The `popitem()` method**: removes and returns a key-value pair from the dictionary. This creates a way to process items one by one while simultaneously removing them from the dictionary. It's "destructive" because it permanently modifies the dictionary by removing items as you iterate.

This approach is useful when:

* You need to process each item exactly once
* You want to ensure items are removed as you go (to free memory or prevent duplicate processing)
* You don't need to preserve the original dictionary

```python
car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'year': 2003,
}

last_pair = car.popitem()  # last_pair = ('year', 2003)
print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'blue'}
```

4. **The `clear()` method**: removes all items from a dictionary, resulting in an empty dictionary. Mutates the original dictionary object and does not return any values.
```python
car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'year': 2003,
}

car.clear()
print(car)  # {}
```

5. Dictionary Comprehension for Selective Removal: To remove multiple items based on a condition, you can use dictionary comprehension.  
```python
car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'mileage': 80_000,
    'year': 2003,
    'previous_owners': 2,
}

# Remove all keys that have numeric values
car = {k: v for k, v in car.items() if not isinstance(v, int)}
print(car)  # {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'blue'}
```

Be sure not to remove while iterating through it, instead create a copy or collect keys to remove first.

```python
# This will cause unexpected behavior and probably unwanted 
words = ['scooby', 'do', 'on', 'channel', 'two']
for word in words:
    print(word)  # prints: scooby, do, on, channel, two (in that order)
    words.remove(word)

print(words)  # Prints: ['do', 'channel']

# Safer approach
car = {'type': 'sedan', 'color': 'blue', 'mileage': 80_000}
keys_to_remove = [k for k in car if k != 'type']
for key in keys_to_remove:
    del car[key]
```

#### Dictionary Methods

* `dict.keys()`: returns a `dict_keys` object containing all the keys in the dictionary, not a list. It is dynamic however, and will update if the dictionary changes. Can be converted to a list using `list(car.keys())`. Useful for iterating through all keys in a dictionary.

```python

car = {
    'type': 'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'year': 2003,
}

keys = car.keys()  # dict_keys(['type', 'color', 'year'])
```

**`dict.values()`**: returns a dict_values object containing all the values in the dictionary, and is likewise dynamic like `dict.keys()`. 
`values = car.values()  # dict_values(['sedan', 'blue', 2003])`

Can include duplicate values (unlike keys, which must be unique) and useful when you need to work with all values without their associated keys. 
```python
grades = {'Math': 95, 'Science': 88, 'History': 92}

# Calculate average without needing the subject names
average = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
print(f"Average grade: {average}")  # Average grade: 91.67

# Check if a specific value exists
if 88 in grades.values():
    print("Someone got an 88!")
```

**`dict.items()`**: returns a dict_items object containing all key-value pairs as tuples, and is especially useful for iteration, especially over both keys and values.

```python

items = car.items()  # dict_items([('type', 'sedan'), ('color', 'blue'), ('year', 2003)])

# Printing each key-value pair
for key, value in car.items():
    print(f"The car's {key} is {value}.")

numbers = {
    'high':   100,
    'medium': 50,
    'low':    10,
}

for key, value in numbers.items():
    print(f"A {key} number is {value}.")

```

```python
def new_dictionary(old_dictionary):   #creating a new dictionary from an old dictionary
    
    new_dict = {} 
    for key, values in old_dictionary.items() :
        new_dict[key] = values
    return new_dict

```

**`dict.get()`**: retrieves a value associated with a key. It is safer than bracket notation because it doesn't raise `KeyError` for missing keys. It provides a clean way to handle missing keys with default values. Can be chained for nested dictionaries: `data.get('user', {}).get('address', {})`

These usually work together!

```python

# Check if a specific value exists in the dictionary
if 'blue' in car.values():
    print("The car is blue")
    
# Check if a specific key exists
if 'model' not in car.keys():  # or simply: if 'model' not in car:
    car['model'] = 'standard'
```

#### Here's a quick syntax review:

```python

# Get all keys
keys = car.keys()  # dict_keys(['type', 'color', 'year'])

# Get all values
values = car.values()  # dict_values(['sedan', 'blue', 2003])

# Get all key-value pairs
items = car.items()  # dict_items([('type', 'sedan'), ('color', 'blue'), ('year', 2003)])
```

#### Nested Dictionaries

These happen alot:

Creating a nested dictionary

```python
 
nested_dict = {
    'person1': {
        'name': 'John',
        'age': 30,
        'hobbies': ['reading', 'hiking']
    },
    'person2': {
        'name': 'Lisa',
        'age': 25,
        'hobbies': ['painting', 'running']
    }
}

# Accessing nested elements
john_age = nested_dict['person1']['age']  # Gets 30
lisa_hobby = nested_dict['person2']['hobbies'][1]  # Gets 'running'

# Adding new nested data
nested_dict['person3'] = {'name': 'Mike', 'age': 35, 'hobbies': ['swimming']}

# Modifying nested data
nested_dict['person1']['hobbies'].append('cooking')
```

### Lists vs. Dictionaries

* Lists in Python are typically used for storing items in a particular order.

* The most common action you'll see performed on a dictionary is to look up the value for a particular key.

* Use Dictionaries when you need to look up one value based on another in Python.

* If you care about looping, but you don't care about key lookups, you probably don't need a dictionary. If looping is all you need, a list of tuples might be a better way.

* When you loop over a dictionary, you'll get keys. If you'd like to get keys and values, you can use the dictionary items method.

But remember to ask yourself, why am I looping here and do I need a dictionary or would a list be a better way to store my data?

[Back to the top](#top)

#### List to Dictionary Conversion

There are several ways to convert a list to a dictionary:

1. ​Using a list of key-value pairs:
```python
# List of key-value pairs (tuples)
key_value_pairs = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

# Convert to dictionary using dict() constructor
my_dict = dict(key_value_pairs)
# Result: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

2. Using Dictionary Comprehension:

```python
python

# From two separate lists
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]

# Create dictionary via comprehension
my_dict = {keys[i]: values[i] for i in range(len(keys))}
# Result: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

3. Using `zip()` function

```python
eys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]

# Zip the lists together and convert to dictionary
my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
# Result: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Further examples:

```python
# Iterate through a list to build a dictionary
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
# Create a dictionary with the items as keys and their lengths as values
fruit_lengths = {}
for fruit in my_list:
    fruit_lengths[fruit] = len(fruit)

# Alternatively, using dictionary comprehension
fruit_lengths = {fruit: len(fruit) for fruit in my_list}
# Result: {'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6, 'date': 4}
```

Converting a list of dictionaries into a dictionary:
```python

products = [
    {'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200, 'stock': 10},
    {'name': 'Phone', 'price': 800, 'stock': 25},
    {'name': 'Tablet', 'price': 500, 'stock': 5},
    {'name': 'Headphones', 'price': 200, 'stock': 50}
]

#Creating dictionary with product names as keys

name_dict = {item['name']: item for item in products}
print(name_dict)

# Creating a dictionary with a for loop

name_dict = {}
for item in products:
    name_dict[item['name']] = item
print(name_dict)

# Using indices as keys
index_dict = {i: product for i, product in enumerate(products)}
print(index_dict)

```

### A List of Dictionaries!

Lists of dictionaries are a common data structure in Python that allows you to store multiple records, each with named fields. Let's explore how to work with them effectively.

#### Basic Structure

```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85, 'subjects': ['Math', 'Science']},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 92, 'subjects': ['History', 'English']},
    {'name': 'Casey', 'grade': 78, 'subjects': ['Art', 'Music']}
]
```

#### Common Operations with Lists of Dictionaries

1. **Accessing Elements**

You can access individual dictionaries using list indexing, and then access dictionary values using keys:

```python
first_student = students[0]  # Gets the first dictionary
name = students[0]['name']   # Gets 'Alex
```

2. **Iterating Through the List**

```python
for student in students:
    print(f"{student['name']} has a grade of {student['grade']}")
```

3. **Filtering the List**

You can filter a list of dictionaries using list comprehensions:

```python
# Get students with grades above 80
high_performers = [student for student in students if student['grade'] > 80]
```

4. **Sorting the List**
To sort a list of dictionaries, you can use the sorted() function with a key parameter:

```python
# Sort by grade (ascending)
sorted_by_grade = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['grade'])

# Sort by name (alphabetically)
sorted_by_name = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['name'])

# Sort by grade (descending)
sorted_by_grade_desc = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['grade'], reverse=True)
```

5. **Converting Lists of Dictionaries to Other Formats**

You can extract specific information from a list of dictionaries:

```python
# Get all names in a list
names = [student['name'] for student in students]

# Create a dictionary mapping names to grades
name_to_grade = {student['name']: student['grade'] for student in students}
```

6. **Finding a Specific Dictionary**

```python
# Find a student by name
def find_student(name):
    for student in students:
        if student['name'] == name:
            return student
    return None

jamie = find_student('Jamie')
```

#### Working with Nested Data

When you have nested data in your dictionaries, like the 'subjects' list in our example:

```python
# Get all subjects across all students (flattened)
all_subjects = []
for student in students:
    all_subjects.extend(student['subjects'])

# Get unique subjects
unique_subjects = list(set(all_subjects))
```

#### Dictionary View Methods with Lists of Dictionaries

You can use dictionary view methods like `keys()`, `values()`, `and items()` on each dictionary:

```python
# Get all keys from the first student
first_student_keys = list(students[0].keys())  # ['name', 'grade', 'subjects']

# Get all values from the first student
first_student_values = list(students[0].values())  # ['Alex', 85, ['Math', 'Science']]
```
#### Working with Dictionaries in Lists: `Update`, `Append`, `Remove` Operations

Working with lists of dictionaries requires understanding how to manipulate both the list structure and the dictionary objects within it. Here are the key operations you might need:

**Updating a Dictionary in a List**

When you want to update a dictionary that's an element in a list, you first need to access that dictionary, then modify it:

```python
# Sample list of dictionaries
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 92},
    {'name': 'Casey', 'grade': 78}
]

# Update Jamie's grade
students[1]['grade'] = 95

# Add a new key-value pair to Alex's record
students[0]['attendance'] = 98

print(students)
# [{'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85, 'attendance': 98}, 
#  {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 95}, 
#  {'name': 'Casey', 'grade': 78}]
```

You can also find and update a dictionary using a loop:
```python
for student in students:
    if student['name'] == 'Casey':
        student['grade'] = 80
```

**Appending to a List Within a Dictionary**
If a dictionary contains a list value, you can append to it:

```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'courses': ['Math', 'Science']},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'courses': ['History']}
]

# Append a course to Jamie's courses
students[1]['courses'].append('English')

print(students)
# [{'name': 'Alex', 'courses': ['Math', 'Science']}, 
#  {'name': 'Jamie', 'courses': ['History', 'English']}]
```

It's important to understand that when you modify nested data structures like this, you're working with references.

**Removing Items**

*Remove a Key-Value Pair from a Dictionary*
```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85, 'id': 1001},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 92, 'id': 1002}
]

# Remove the 'id' from Jamie's record
del students[1]['id']

# Alternative: using pop() to remove and return the value
id_value = students[0].pop('id')
print(f"Removed ID: {id_value}")
```

*Remove a Dictionary from the List*
```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 92},
    {'name': 'Casey', 'grade': 78}
]

# Remove by index
del students[1]  # Removes Jamie's record

# Alternative: using pop() to remove by index
removed_student = students.pop(0)  # Removes Alex's record
print(f"Removed student: {removed_student}")

# Remove by value using list comprehension
students = [student for student in students if student['name'] != 'Casey']

# Or using remove() with a loop
students = [
    {'name': 'Alex', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'Jamie', 'grade': 92}
]
for student in students[:]:  # Make a copy of the list for iteration
    if student['name'] == 'Alex':
        students.remove(student)
```

**Important Considerations**

1.  When working with shared references in nested structures, modifications affect all references to that object.
2.  For shallow copying a list or dictionary, you can use `.copy()` method:
3.  Remember that dictionary mutations like `append()` or adding keys affect the original object, as they're destructive operations.

### Other Python Collections

1. **Tuples**: Immutable, ordered sequence. Uses `()`.
​
Use Cases​:

* When you need data that shouldn't change (like coordinates, RGB values)
* Dictionary keys (since they must be immutable)
* Returning multiple values from a function

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
rgb_color = (255, 0, 127)
```

Tuples are immutable but can have mutable elements, most commonly lists.  To mutate a tuple's mutable elements, do the following:

```python
tuple2 = (1, 2, [3, 4])
tuple2[2][0] = 9  # Modifies the first element of the list inside the tuple
print(tuple2)     # Outputs: (1, 2, [9, 4])
```

2. **Sets**: Unordered collection, no duplicates, mutable but contains only immutable objects. Uses `{}`

​Use Cases​:

* When you need to ensure uniqueness of elements
* Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
* Membership testing for large collections (faster than list)

```python
# Creating a set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
tags = {"python", "programming", "tutorial"}
```

Sets in Python are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation by:

* Adding elements using `add()` or `update()`
* Removing elements using `remove()`, `discard()`, or `pop()`
* Clearing all elements with `clear()`

While sets themselves are mutable, they can only contain hashable objects, which in Python are typically immutable objects. This is because sets use a hash table implementation internally for fast lookups.

These objects can be included in sets:

* Integers: `{1, 2, 3}`
* Floats: `{1.1, 2.2, 3.3}`
* Strings: `{"apple", "banana"}`
* Tuples (if they contain only immutable objects): `{(1, 2), (3, 4)}`

These objects CANNOT be included in sets:

* Lists: `{[1, 2], [3, 4]}` 
* Dictionaries: `{{1: 'a'}, {2: 'b'}} `
* Sets: `{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}` 

But wait! There's more! There are frozen sets!

3. **frozen set** is an immutable version of a regular set. Once created, you cannot modify its contents - no adding, removing, or changing elements. Frozen sets are significant because their immutability makes them hashable, which means:

Key Characteristics​:

* Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
* Unordered collection of unique elements
* Can only contain immutable (hashable) objects
    * making them useful as dictionary keys
    * make them useful as elements in other sets
* Created using the `frozenset()` constructor function
* Supports all set operations that don't modify the set (intersection, union, etc.)

```python
# Creating a frozen set
frozen_colors = frozenset(["red", "blue", "green"])

# Attempting to modify will cause errors
frozen_colors.add("yellow")  # AttributeError!
```

Keep in mind:

* frozen sets are useful when you need an immutable collection of unique items
* They support methods like `isdisjoint()`, `issubset()`, and `issuperset()`
* They can be created from any iterable (lists, tuples, regular sets, etc.)
* They cannot be modified after creation

The key difference between sets and frozensets is their mutability. While **both are unordered collections of unique** elements, **regular sets can be modified** after creation, whereas **frozensets are immutable**. This immutability makes frozensets hashable, so they can be used as dictionary keys or as elements in other sets.

How to Differentiate Between Collections:

| Collection | Ordered? | Mutable? | Allows Duplicates? | Indexable?     | Syntax                 |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| List       | Yes      | Yes      | Yes                | Yes            | [1, 2, 3]            |
| Dictionary | Yes*     | Yes      | No (keys)          | No (uses keys) | {'a': 1, 'b': 2}     |
| Tuple      | Yes      | No       | Yes                | Yes            | (1, 2, 3)            |
| Set        | No       | Yes      | No                 | No             | {1, 2, 3}            |
| Range      | Yes      | No       | No                 | Yes            | range(1, 4)          |
| Frozenset  | No       | No       | No                 | No             | frozenset([1, 2, 3]) |

#### When to Use Each Collection

* ​Lists​: When you need a mutable, ordered collection that can contain duplicate items
* ​Dictionaries​: When you need key-value pairs for quick lookups
* Tuples​: When you want an immutable ordered collection
* Sets​: When you need to ensure uniqueness or perform set operations
* ​Ranges​: When you need a sequence of numbers without storing them all

### Not gonna lie, there's a lot of tuples

Converting a tuple of lists to a dictionary:

```python
# Creating a tuple that contains lists
tuple_with_lists = ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])

# Accessing elements
first_list = tuple_with_lists[0]  # Gets [1, 2, 3]
specific_element = my_tuple[1][1]  # Gets 5
element = tuple_with_lists[1][2]  # Gets 6 (second list, third element)

# Modifying a list inside the tuple (tuples are immutable, but their contents may be mutable)
tuple_with_lists[0].append(4)  # tuple_with_lists becomes ([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
```

#### Mutability Characteristics with Tuples

This is where it gets interesting:

1.  The tuple itself is ​immutable​ - you cannot add, remove, or replace elements in the tuple
2.  The lists inside the tuple are ​mutable​ - you can modify their contents

What you CAN'T do:
```python
my_tuple = ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
my_tuple[0] = [10, 11, 12]  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
my_tuple += ([7, 8, 9],)  # Creates a new tuple, doesn't modify the original
```

What you CAN do:

```python
my_tuple = ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
my_tuple[0].append(4)  # Valid! The tuple now contains ([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6])
my_tuple[1][0] = 10    # Valid! The tuple now contains ([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 5, 6])
```

Real World Applications:

Tuples containing lists are useful when you need:
1.  A fixed structure with specific positions (the tuple part)
2.  With elements that need to be modified (the list part)

For example, you might use this structure to represent:
* A game board with rows that can change
* Configuration data with changeable subsections
* Coordinates with history tracking

An example of a complex nested structure:

```python

# Tuple containing dictionaries
records = (
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 95]},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": [75, 80, 85]}
)

# You can modify the dictionaries or lists inside
records[0]["scores"].append(100)  # Adding a score for Alice
```

## Slicing: Strings, Lists, and Tuples

Slicing is a powerful Python feature that lets you extract portions of sequences like strings, lists, and tuples.

The basic syntax for slicing is: `sequence[start:stop:step]`

Where:
* start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive)
* stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive)
* step: The interval between elements in the slice

When any parameter is omitted:
* Missing start defaults to 0 (beginning of sequence)
* Missing stop defaults to the length of the sequence
* Missing step defaults to 1 (every element)

Common Slicing Patterns
```python
# Basic slicing
sequence[2:5]    # Elements at indices 2, 3, and 4
sequence[:5]     # First 5 elements
sequence[5:]     # Elements from index 5 to the end
sequence[:]      # A copy of the entire sequence

# Step parameter
sequence[::2]    # Every second element (0, 2, 4...)
sequence[1::2]   # Every second element starting from index 1 (1, 3, 5...)
sequence[::-1]   # Reverse the sequence
sequence[::-2]   # Every second element, in reverse order
```

Negative indices count from the end of the sequence:
```python
sequence[-3:]     # Last 3 elements
sequence[:-3]     # Everything except the last 3 elements
sequence[-5:-2]   # Elements from 5th last to 3rd last (not including 3rd last)
```

Comparing characters in a string sequentially:

```python
def compare_characters_sequentially(s):
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
            print(f"Characters at position {i} and {i + 1} are the same: {s[i]}")
        else:
            print(f"Characters at position {i} and {i + 1} are different: {s[i]} and {s[i + 1]}")

```

### Slicing Examples with Different Data Types

#### String Slicing

```python
text = "Python Programming"
print(text[0:6])      # "Python"
print(text[7:])       # "Programming"
print(text[::-1])     # "gnimmargorP nohtyP" (reversed)
print(text[::2])      # "Pto rgamn" (every second character)
```
#### List Slicing

```python 
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[2:5])   # [2, 3, 4]
print(numbers[:4])    # [0, 1, 2, 3]
print(numbers[6:])    # [6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[::2])   # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] (every second element)
```

#### Tuple Slicing

```python
coordinates = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print(coordinates[0:2])   # (1, 2)
print(coordinates[3:])    # (4, 5, 6)
print(coordinates[::-1])  # (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
```

#### Important Properties of Slicing

1. **​Returns a New Object**​: Slicing creates a new object, it doesn't modify the original sequence.
2. **​Immutability Preserved**​: If the original is immutable (like strings or tuples), the slice will also be immutable.
3. **​Handling Out-of-Range Indices**​: Slicing gracefully handles out-of-range indices

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[2:100])  # "thon" (exceeding the length is okay)
print(text[100:])   # "" (empty string, no error)
```

4. **Using Variables**​: You can use variables for slice parameters:
```python
start = 2
end = 5
print(text[start:end])
```

5. **Finding Elements with a Step**​: The exercise "Odd Lists" demonstrates using a step value of 2 to get every second element:

```python
 # Getting every second element
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print(my_list[::2])  # [1, 3, 5]
   
   # Getting every second element starting from the second element
   print(my_list[1::2])  # [2, 4]
```

Frequent applications:

1.  ​Getting Middle Characters​:
```python

   # For strings with odd length
   def middle_character(string):
       return string[len(string) // 2]
       
   # For strings with even length - returns two middle characters
   def middle_characters(string):
       middle = len(string) // 2
       return string[middle-1:middle+1]
```

2. Creating a copy:
```python
original = [1, 2, 3]
copy = original[:]  # Creates a shallow copy
```

3. ​Reversing a Sequence​: `reversed_sequence = sequence[::-1]`

#### Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

1.  **​Confusing stop Index**​: Remember that the stop index is exclusive (not included in the slice).
2.  **​IndexError vs. Slicing**​: While `list[6] = 5` would raise an `IndexError` if the list doesn't have 7 elements, slicing like `list[2:6]` will not raise an error even if the list is shorter.
3.  **​Modifying Slices​**: Modifying a slice of a mutable object doesn't modify the original.

## I/O Functions


### The `print()` Function

The `print()` function is used to output data to the console.
```python

# Python 3 (correct)
print("Hello, Python!")

# Python 2 style (will cause SyntaxError in Python 3)
print "Hello, Python!"  # SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
```

Basic Usage:

```python

# python, basic

print("Hello, world!")

# Multiple paramaters

name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)  # Outputs: Name: Alice Age: 30

# Separator between arguments, default is space

print("Hello", "world", sep="-")  # Outputs: Hello-world

# end: String appended after the last value (default is newline)

print("Hello", end="! ")
print("World")  # Outputs: Hello! World

# file: Object with a write method (default is sys.stdout)
 with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
       print("Writing to file", file=f)

# Escape sequences

print("Line 1\nLine 2")  # \n creates a new line
print("Tab\tspacing")    # \t creates a tab

# Formatted Strings

name = "Bob"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # f-strings (Python 3.6+)
print("Hello, {}!".format(name))  # .format() method
```

Using `print()` doesn't create new references to objects.

[Back to the top](#top)


### The `input()` Function

The `input()` function reads a line from the console, converts it to a string, and returns it. It always returns a string, in the process creating a new string object in memory. This string is inherently truthy. Remember that an empty string is inherently falsy.

```python

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Type Conversions, input() always returns a string

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Input validation

while True:
       try:
           number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
           break
       except ValueError:
           print("That's not a valid number. Try again.")

# Handling empty input with default values

   response = input("Enter a value (default is 'yes'): ") or "yes"

# Multiline input

print("Enter multiple lines (press Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z to finish):")
lines = []
while True:
    try:
        line = input()
        lines.append(line)
        except EOFError:
            break

# Using truthiness to handle input validation

name = ""
while not name:  # Loop continues until a non-empty string is entered
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")

```

Input processing loop:

```python

   while True:
       command = input("Enter command (q to quit): ")
       if command.lower() == 'q':
           break
       # Process command
```

Getting yes/no input:

```python
while True:
       response = input("Continue? (y/n): ").lower()
       if response in ('y', 'yes'):
           # Continue
           break
       elif response in ('n', 'no'):
           # Exit
           break
       else:
           print("Please enter y or n.")
```

​String Immutability​: Remember that strings in Python are immutable, so operations on `input()` results create new objects:

```python
user_input = input("Enter text: ")
modified = user_input.upper()  # Creates a new string object   
print(user_input is modified)  # False - different objects
```

#### Pass by Object Reference

When you pass variables to `print()` or store results from `input()`, Python uses its "**pass by object reference**" model

```python

def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append("modified")  # Modifies the original list object

user_list = ["original"]
modify_list(user_list)
print(user_list)  # ['original', 'modified']

# But input() results (strings) are immutable
def try_modify_string(s):
    s = s + " modified"  # Creates a new string, doesn't modify original
    return s

user_input = input("Enter text: ")
modified = try_modify_string(user_input)
print(user_input)  # Original input is unchanged
print(modified)    # Shows the modified version
```

#### Global Variables and I/O Functions


When using `input()` and `print()` inside functions, be aware of scope issues
```python
name = "Default"

def get_user_info():
    name = input("Enter name: ")  # Creates a local 'name' variable
    print(f"Inside function: {name}")

get_user_info()
print(f"Outside function: {name}")  # Still "Default" unless you use 'global name'
```

#### None and Input Handling


Understanding how `None` (a falsy value) interacts with I/O is important:

```python
def get_valid_input():
    user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
    try:
        return int(user_input)
    except ValueError:
        return None  # Return None for invalid input

result = get_valid_input()
if result is not None:  # Check for None specifically
    print(f"Valid number: {result}")
else:
    print("Invalid input")
```

## Exceptions and Exception Handling

Exceptions in Python occur when the normal flow of a program is disrupted due to an error or unexpected condition. 


### Common Situations That Trigger Exceptions

#### Syntax Errors

These occur before your program even runs
```python
print('hello)  # SyntaxError: unterminated string
def (  # SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

#### User Input and External Resources

Exceptions commonly occur when dealing with:

1. **​User input**​: Users often provide input in unexpected formats
2. **​File operations​**: Files might be missing, permissions might be wrong, etc
3. **Network operations**​: Network connections can fail, servers can be down, etc.

Unlike other exceptions, syntax errors are detected by the Python parser when loading your program, before execution begins, as noted in the [PY101 - Errors](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/378f8121) lesson.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is an important aspect of Python programming that allows you to gracefully manage errors that occur during program execution.

#### Basic Exception Handling Structure

Python uses a `try`/`except` block structure for exception handling:

```python

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the specific exception
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

From Rock Paper Scissors:

```python

def invalid_number(number_str):
    try:
        int(number_str)
    except ValueError:
        return True
    return False
```

Python has many built-in exceptions, also known as **Run Time Errors**:

* `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division by zero occurs
* `TypeError`: Raised when an operation is performed on an inappropriate type
* `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value
* `NameError`: Raised when a local or global name is not found or doesn't exist. 
* `IndexError`: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range
* `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found
* `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn't exist


#### Multiple Exception Handlers


You can handle different exceptions differently:

```python
try:
    num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = int(num_str)
    result = 10 / num
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    print("Exception handling complete.")

```

#### Catching Multiple Exceptions


You can catch multiple exceptions with the same handler:

```python
try:
    # Some code
    pass
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    # Handle both exceptions the same way
    print("Invalid input")
```


#### The `else` Clause


The `else` clause executes if the try block doesn't raise an exception

```python
try:
    value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
else:
    print(f"You entered {value}")
```

### The finally Clause


The finally clause always executes, whether an exception occurred or not:

```python
try:
    file = open('data.txt')
    data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found!")
finally:
    if 'file' in locals() and not file.closed:
        file.close()
    print("Cleanup complete")

```


#### Raising Exceptions


You can raise exceptions with the raise statement

```python 

def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
    if age > 120:
        raise ValueError("Age is unrealistic")
    return age
```

#### Creating Custom Exceptions


You can create your own exception types by inheriting from Exception

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for specific situations"""
    pass

# Usage
if something_went_wrong:
    raise CustomError("Something went wrong!")
```

#### Exception Handling Best Practices

1. Be specific with your exception handling - avoid catching all exceptions with a bare `except:` clause.
2. Keep the `try` block as small as possible
3. Use `finally` for cleanup code
4. Document which exceptions your functions might raise

## That's How They Get Ya

The following are tricky bits of code tried in TA led sessions.

#### What is a literal?

Any syntatic notation that lets you directly represent an object in source code.

#### How do you identify a method versus a function?

A method occurs when an object is followed by a . and then followed by a function invocation. Whereas a function is a function invocation followed by () with the object passed into the ().

#### What's wrong with this code?

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]

def empty_list(lst):
    for idx in range(len(lst)):
        lst.pop(idx)
    return lst

print(empty_list(lst))
print(lst)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The issue with the code is that modifying a list while iterating over it using its indices can lead to unexpected behavior. When you remove an element from the list using pop(idx), the indices of the subsequent elements are shifted, which can cause elements to be skipped or lead to an `IndexError`.


A better approach is to clear the list directly or iterate over a copy of the list, using `lst.clear()` or a `while` loop. But if you need to preserve the for loop, then its this:

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]

def empty_list(lst):
    for idx in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):
        lst.pop(idx)
    return lst

print(empty_list(lst))  # Output: []
print(lst)  # Output: []
```

By iterating over the copied list in reverse order: Using range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1), we generate the indices from the last element to the first. This allows us to remove elements from the end to the beginning without affecting the indices of the remaining elements.

One can also do the following: 

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]

def empty_list(lst):
    for _ in range(len(lst)):
        lst.pop()
    return lst

print(empty_list(lst))
print(lst)
```

#### What's wrong with this code?

```python
lst1 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
lst2 = lst1.reverse() and lst1.reverse()
if lst2:
    print(lst2)
else:
    print(lst1)
```

1. First, `lst1 `is initialized as the list `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
2.  The second line is where things get interesting:
   * `lst1.reverse()` reverses the list in place. This means it modifies `lst1` directly and returns `None`.
   * The `and` operator evaluates the left expression first, which is `lst1.reverse()`. Since this returns `None`, and `None` is falsy in Python, the right side of the and (`lst1.reverse()`) is not executed due to short-circuit evaluation.
   * Therefore, `lst2` is assigned the value `None`.
3.  In the if statement, `None` is considered falsy, so the code enters the `else` block.
4.  Inside the `else `block, it prints lst1. Since `lst1.reverse()` was called once, `lst1` is now `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.


#### What will this code do?

```python
   def outer():
       x = "local"
       def inner():
           nonlocal x
           x = "nonlocal"
       inner()
       return x
   
   print(outer())

```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

It prints out `nonlocal`.

```python
def outer():
    x = "local"  # `x` is defined in the scope of the `outer` function.
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal x  # Refers to the `x` defined in the enclosing `outer` function.
        x = "nonlocal"  # Modifies the `x` variable in the `outer` function's scope.
    
    inner()  # Calls `inner`, which modifies `x` in the `outer` scope.
    return x  # Returns the modified value of `x`.

print(outer())  # Prints the value returned by `outer`.
```

</details>

#### What will this code do?

```python
def add_to_list(item, my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(item)
    return my_list

list1 = add_to_list(1)
list2 = add_to_list(2)

print(list1)  # [1, 2]
print(list2)  # [1, 2]
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

the default argument my_list=[] is evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This creates a single list object that persists between function calls.
Here's the sequence of events:
1.  When the function is defined, Python creates an empty list as the default value for `my_list`
2.  When `add_to_list(1)` is called, 1 is appended to this list, resulting in `[1]`
3.  When `add_to_list(2)` is called, 2 is appended to the same list, resulting in `[1, 2]`
4.  Both `list1` and `list2` reference this same list object

"In Python, default mutable arguments are shared between function calls. This means that if you modify the default argument, its state will persist across function calls."
The proper way to handle this situation is to use None as the default and initialize a new list inside the function:

```python
def add_to_list(item, my_list=None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(item)
    return my_list
```

With this pattern, each function call that doesn't provide a list argument will get a fresh empty list, avoiding the shared state problem. This is an excellent example of how understanding mutability and Python's evaluation of default arguments is crucial for writing bug-free code.

#### What will this code do?

```python
exclamation_marks = '!!!'

def shout(text):
    return text.upper() + exclamation_marks

print(shout('hello') + exclamation_marks)
```

1.  First, a global variable exclamation_marks is created and assigned the string value `'!!!'`.

2.  Then a function named shout is defined that:
   •   Takes one parameter called text
   •   Converts this text to uppercase using the `.upper() `string method
   •   Concatenates the uppercase text with the global variable exclamation_marks
   •   Returns this concatenated string
3.  Finally, the code calls `print(shout('hello') + exclamation_marks) `which:
   •   Calls the shout function with the argument `'hello'`
   •   The shout function returns `'HELLO!!!'` (uppercase 'hello' + the exclamation marks)
   •   This return value is then concatenated with exclamation_marks again
   •   So the final string being printed is `'HELLO!!!!!!'` (the function's return value another set of exclamation marks)

This is a demonstration of Python's variable scope. The exclamation_marks variable defined in the global scope is accessible within the function without needing any special declaration. The function uses this global variable in its own calculation, and then the global variable is used again after the function returns.

This differs from how variable reassignment works in functions. If the function tried to reassign exclamation_marks, it would create a local variable instead of modifying the global one unless the global keyword was used.

**Why does it return the string as upper without it being reassigned in a variable?**

Looking at how the `upper()` method works in Python, there's an important concept to understand: string methods in Python don't modify the original string but instead return a new string with the changes applied.

In the shout function:
```python
def shout(text):
    return text.upper() + exclamation_marks
```

The `text.upper()` method creates and returns a new string with all characters converted to uppercase. This happens because strings in Python are immutable - they cannot be changed after they're created.

When you call `text.upper()`, Python:
1.  Creates a brand new string with all uppercase characters
2.  Returns this new string
3.  The original text parameter remains unchanged
This is exactly what we see in the "ALL CAPS" exercise from Python Basics, where string.`upper()` returns a new uppercase string while leaving the original string unchanged:

```python
string = 'confetti floating everywhere'
uppercased_string = string.upper()  # Creates a new string
print(uppercased_string)  # CONFETTI FLOATING EVERYWHERE
```

You don't necessarily need to assign the result to a variable - you can use the returned value directly in expressions, which is what the shout function does when it immediately concatenates the uppercase string with the exclamation marks.

This behavior is consistent across Python string methods - they return new strings rather than modifying the original strings. It's a key concept to understand when working with strings in Python due to their immutable nature.
