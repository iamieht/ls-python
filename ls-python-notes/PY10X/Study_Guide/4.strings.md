# Strings

## Basics

* **Strings** are an immutable sequence of Unicode characters
* String **literals** can be written with a single `('string')` or double `("string")` quotes
* Triple quotes `('''string''')` or `("""string""")` for multi-line strings
* Empty strings are created with `''` or `""`
* **Text sequences** are strings of characters.
* The difference between a **Text sequence** and an **ordinary sequence** is that the **ordinary sequence** contain zero or more objects, while the **text sequence** does not contain any objects: only contains the characters (which are not objects in itself) that make up the text sequence.

## String Operations

•   ​**Concatenation**​: Using the `+` operator (`"hello" + " world"`)  
•   ​**Repetition**​: Using the `*` operator (`"ha" * 3` produces `"hahaha"`)  
•   ​**Indexing**​: Access individual characters (`text[0]`)  
•   ​**Slicing**​: Extract substrings (`text[1:4]`)  
•   ​**Length**​: Using `len()` function (`len("hello")` returns `5`)

## String Methods

•   ​**Case manipulation**​: `upper()`, `lower()`, `capitalize()`, `title()`, `swapcase()`  
•   ​**Testing**​: `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isalnum()`, `isspace()`, `isupper()`, `islower()`  
•   ​**Searching**​: `find()`, `rfind()`, `index()`, `rindex()`, `count()`  
•   ​**Modification**​: `replace()`, `strip()`, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`, `split()`, `join()`

## [String Formatting](5.f-strings)

•   ​**f-strings**​: `f"Hello, {name}!"` (interpolates variables)  
•   ​**format() method**​: `"Hello, {}!".format(name)`  
•   ​`%` **operator**​: `"Hello, %s!" % name` (older style)

## Important Concepts

* Strings are ​**passed by object reference**​ to functions
* String methods ​**return new strings**​ rather than modifying existing ones
* String comparisons use lexicographical (dictionary) ordering
* Escape sequences like `\n`, `\t`, and `\\` for special characters

### Lexicographical (dictionary) ordering

When we talk about lexicographical ordering in string comparisons, we're referring to how Python determines whether one string is "greater than," "less than," or "equal to" another string. This is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary (hence the term "dictionary ordering").

#### How Lexicographical Comparison Works?

When Python compares two strings using operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, or `>=`, it does so character by character, from left to right:
1.  Python compares the first character of each string using their Unicode code points  
2.  If they differ, the comparison result is determined immediately  
3.  If they're the same, Python moves to the next character and repeats the process  
4.  If one string is a prefix of the other (meaning it runs out of characters first), the shorter string is considered "less than" the longer one

* Python compares strings character-by-character from left to right in both strings. The comparison stops as soon as Python reaches a decision.
- `'abcdef' > 'abc'`. In this example, the strings have unequal sizes. Furthermore, the longer string is identical up to the shorter string's length. Python returns `True` here; when it can no longer take characters from the shorter string, it concludes that the longer string has the greater value. Similar behaviors occur with the other ordered comparison operators.
- It's also worth noting that even numeric strings are compared character by character. Thus, `'3' > '24'` returns `True` since the character `3` is greater than the character `2`.
- In general, numeric characters in a string are less than alphabetic characters, and uppercase letter characters are less than lowercase letters.

#### Unicode Ordering

The comparison is based on the Unicode code point (numerical value) of each character. In ASCII/Unicode:

•   Uppercase letters (`A-Z`) come before lowercase letters (`a-z`)  
•   Digits (`0-9`) come before letters  
•   Special characters have their own ordering
## Examples

```python
# String operations
name = "Python"
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"  # Concatenation
repeated = name * 3  # Repetition: "PythonPythonPython"

# Indexing and slicing
first_char = name[0]  # 'P'
substring = name[1:4]  # 'yth'

# String methods
upper_name = name.upper()  # 'PYTHON'
has_digits = name.isdigit()  # False
position = name.find('th')  # 2

# String formatting
age = 30
message = f"{name} is {age} years old"
```
