# Exceptions

## **Key Points About Exceptions in Python**

1. **What They Are**​: Exceptions are events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.
2. **When They Occur**​: You should be able to identify common situations that trigger exceptions, such as:
	1. Attempting to divide by zero
	2. Accessing an index that doesn't exist in a sequence
	3. Using an undefined variable
	4. Type errors (trying operations with incompatible types)
	5. Value errors (passing inappropriate arguments to functions)
3. **How to Handle Them**​: You should understand exception handling using the try/except blocks:

```python
try:
       # Code that might cause an exception
except ExceptionType:
       # Code to run if that exception occurs
```

4. **Common Exception Types**​: Know the basic exception types like ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError, ZeroDivisionError, etc.
