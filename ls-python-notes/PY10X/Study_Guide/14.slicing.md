# Slicing

Slicing allows you to extract parts of sequences like strings, lists, and tuples.

## Syntax

```python
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- `start`: The index where the slice begins (inclusive)
- `stop`: The index where the slice ends (exclusive)
- `step`: The interval between elements (default is 1)

All three parameters are optional:

```python
my_list[2:5]    # From index 2 up to (but not including) index 5
my_list[:5]     # From beginning up to (but not including) index 5
my_list[2:]     # From index 2 to the end
my_list[:]      # A copy of the entire sequence
my_list[::2]    # Every second element
```

## Negative Indices

Python allows negative indices, which count from the end:

```python
my_string = "Python"
my_string[-3:]   # "hon" (last 3 characters)
my_string[:-2]   # "Pyth" (all except last 2 characters)
```

## Reverse Slicing

You can use a negative step to reverse the direction:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list[::-1]    # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (reversed list)
my_list[4:1:-1]  # [5, 4, 3] (from index 4 to index 2, reversed)
```

## Common Applications

1. Extracting substrings: `name = "Launch School"; first_name = name[:6]`
2. Creating copies of sequences: `new_list = original_list[:]`
3. Reversing sequences: `reversed_string = my_string[::-1]`
4. Removing elements from start/end: `without_first_two = my_list[2:]`

## Important Notes

- Slicing creates a new object; it doesn't modify the original
- Out-of-range indices in slices don't cause errors (unlike direct indexing)
- Slices can be used as targets for assignments: `my_list[1:3] = [10, 20]`
- You get an empty slice when the start and stop values are the same.
- Slicing performs a shallow copy if the sequence contains any collections (lists or tuples).

```python
seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(seq[3:7])       # [4, 5, 6, 7]
print(seq[-6:-2])     # [5, 6, 7, 8]
print(seq[2:8:2])     # [3, 5, 7]
print(seq[3:3])       # []
print(seq[:])         # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] => returns a duplicated sequence
print(seq[::-1])      # [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] returns a reverse copy of a sequence

seq = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
seq_dup = seq[:]
print(seq[0] is seq_dup[0])   # True
```
