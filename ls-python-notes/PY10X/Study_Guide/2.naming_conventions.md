# Naming Conventions

* **idiomatic**: Names that follow Python's style convention (PEP8).
* **non-idiomatic**: Names that are legal but do not follow the naming conventions
* **illegal**: Names that are either not allowed or are not syntactically correct.

## Legal vs. Idiomatic

* **Legal Names**  are syntactically valid and do not raise a syntax error.
* **Idiomatic Names**: are those that follow Python's style convention (Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP8)).

Not every variable name that is **legal** is **idiomatic**.

```python
# Legal but non-idiomatic
firstName = "Ivan"
FirstName = "Ivan"
LASTName = "Hernandez"

# Legal and idiomatic
first_name = "Ivan"
MY_CONSTANT = 10
class MyClass():
	pass
```

## Illegal vs. non-idiomatic

* **Illegal names** are those that will raise a syntax error, either because is syntactically incorrect or is a Python's reserved word.
* **Non-idiomatic** names are legal names that do not follow the Python's style convention (PEP8)

Not every **non-idiomatic** name is **illegal**.

```python
# Illegal names
1stName = "Ivan"
first-name = "Ivan"
pass = "I will"
```

## Illegal Names

* Punctuation characters, most special characters, and whitespaces are not allowed
* Names must not begin with a digit
* Python reserved words are not allowed: `if`, `def`, `while`, `for`, `return`, `class` and `pass`
