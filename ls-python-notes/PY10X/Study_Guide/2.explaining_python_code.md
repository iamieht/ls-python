# Explaining Python Code

## Precision of Language

* Say ​**function definition**​ or ​**function invocation / function call**
* Talk about ​**output, return value and mutations**
* A value is assigned to a variable (both forms are acceptable: "the variable is assigned to the value" or "the value is assigned to the variable")
* Use ​**evaluates as true**​ or ​**is truthy**​ when discussing expressions that evaluate to `True` in a Boolean context
* Use ​**is True**​ or ​**is equal to True**​ only when talking about Boolean `True`
* Be concise
* Divide your answers in paragraphs
* Say `a` is initialized and the value `hello` is assigned to it
* Distinguish between function parameters and arguments: a function is defined with parameters but it is called with arguments

### Key Passive Verbs

Below are the main verbs you need to concisely read Python code in English. It’s important to note — using these only becomes easy when you learn to read **right to left.** In the examples listed below, these verbs are **bolded** for emphasis.

- **is invoked / is called**
- **is initialized**
- **is reassigned**
- **is passed**
- **is returned**
- **is mutated**
- **is referenced**
- **is evaluated**
- **is chained**
- **is bound**

### Helpful Active Verbs

- _returns_ — a function _returns_ a value 
- _mutates_ — a method _mutates_ the calling object
- _references_ — a variable _references_ an object
- _binds_ — an object _binds_ to a parameter

Most of the time, passive voice works equally well:

- a value **is returned** by a function
- a calling object **is mutated** by a method
- an object **is referenced** by a variable
- an object **is bound** to a parameter

## **Variable Initialization vs Reassignment**

The first instance in which a variable is assigned a value, that variable gets ​**initialized**​. Any following assignment is a ​**reassignment**​.

```python
a = 'Hello World!'  # => Initialization
b = a               # => Initialization
a = 'Goodbye!'      # => Reassignment
```

_Code Explanation​:

On line 1, global variable `a` is ​**initialized**​ and references the string object `"Hello World!"`. On line 2, global variable `b` is ​**initialized**​ and references the same object as `a`. On line 3, `a` is ​**reassigned**​ to the string object `"Goodbye!"`.

This concept is often visualized using the balloon analogy, which is quite helpful for understanding variable references in Python:

1. When you initialize a variable, it's like tying a string (the variable name) to a balloon (the object in memory).
2. When you assign one variable to another (like `b = a`), both strings are now tied to the same balloon.
3. When you reassign a variable (like `a = 'Goodbye!'`), it's like cutting the string from one balloon and tying it to a new balloon, while the other variable's string remains tied to the original balloon.

This understanding of variables as references to objects is crucial for your assessment. Remember that in Python, all variables are essentially references or pointers to objects in memory.

If we were to print the values after each operation:

```python
a = 'Hello World!'
print(a)  # Output: Hello World!

b = a
print(b)  # Output: Hello World!

a = 'Goodbye!'
print(a)  # Output: Goodbye!
print(b)  # Output: Hello World!
```

Notice that changing `a` doesn't affect `b` because reassignment creates a new reference rather than modifying the existing object.

## Function Invocation

In Python, we distinguish between:
1.  Methods - functions that belong to objects  
2.  Regular functions - standalone functions

Methods are called on an object when they appear after the object, separated by a dot.

```python
"hello world!".upper()
```

_Code Explanation:_

The `upper` method ​**is called**​ on the string object `"hello world!"`. 

An object gets passed into a function invocation when the object appears inside the function call, usually delimited by parentheses.

```python
print('hello world!')
```

_Code Explanation:_

The `print` function ​**is invoked**​ and gets passed the string object `"hello world!"` as an argument.

This distinction between methods and functions is important for your PY109 assessment. When explaining code, precision of language matters greatly. The Study Guide for PY109 Exam emphasizes using proper terminology when describing code behavior.

For example, in Python:

•   `len([1, 2, 3])` is a function invocation where a list is passed as an argument  
•   `[1, 2, 3].append(4)` is a method invocation on a list object

## _Arguments vs Parameters in Python_

Arguments are objects that get passed into a function, only at the function invocation. Parameters are placeholder variables that allow the arguments to be used within the function.

```python
def say(string):
    print(string)

say('hello')
```

_Code Explanation:_

The `say` function is ​_invoked_​ and gets passed the string object `"hello"` as an ​_argument_​, which is then ​_bound_​ to the function's ​_parameter_​ `string`.

This distinction between arguments and parameters is crucial for your PY109 assessment. When explaining Python code, you'll need to accurately identify:
•   Parameters appear in function definitions  
•   Arguments are the actual values passed when calling the function

Understanding this terminology will help you accurately describe code behavior during your assessment. Remember that in Python, like in Ruby, being precise about these terms demonstrates clarity of understanding.

## **Return vs Output**

A function will always return a value in Python (by default it returns `None`), but may not always output one. An outputted value gets printed to the console.

```python
print(['a', 'b', 'c'].pop())
```

_Code Explanation:_

The `pop()` method is called on the list object `['a', 'b', 'c']`, which removes and ​_returns_​ the last element `'c'`. `'c'` is then passed as an argument to the `print()` function, ​_outputting_​ it to the console.

## _True vs Truthy_

In Python, most values evaluate as true (are truthy), except for specific falsy values. 

The falsy values in Python are:
•   `False`  
•   `None`  
•   `0`, `0.0`, `0j` (zero in any numeric format)  
•   `""` (empty string)  
•   `[]` (empty list)  
•   `{}` (empty dictionary)  
•   `()` (empty tuple)  
•   `set()` (empty set)  
•   `range(0)` (empty range)

Everything else evaluates as true, which doesn't mean it equals the Boolean `True`.

```python
if 5 > 1:
    print('5 is greater than 1')
```

_Code Explanation:_

Because `5 > 1` ​**evaluates as true**​, the string object `'5 is greater than 1'` is output.

This distinction between truthiness and the actual Boolean value `True` is critical for your assessment. As noted in the [PY109 Study Guide](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8):"Use 'evaluates to true' or 'is truthy' when discussing expressions that only have to be truthy. Do not use 'is `True`' or 'is equal to `True`' unless you are specifically discussing the boolean value `True`."

## _Basic Rules for Python Code Explanations_

### **Say It Once**

Once you explain what an object is or what a function does, there is no need to explain it again.

```python
a = 1
a = 2
```

_Code Explanation:_

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `1`. On line 2, `a` is reassigned to `2`.

This principle of conciseness and avoiding redundancy is especially important for your assessment. As noted in the [Study Guide for PY109 Exam](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8), you should avoid creating "laundry lists" of facts about code that don't connect together in a meaningful way.

The study guide emphasizes that a good explanation:
•   Avoids repeating the same information multiple times  
•   Shows logical progression and connection between concepts  
•   Demonstrates understanding of underlying principles, not just surface details

Remember that code is not just a series of independent lines - each line's effect depends on what happened before, and influences what happens later. When explaining code for your assessment, focus on these connections and avoid unnecessarily repeating explanations you've already provided.

### Use markdown to refer to code objects

### When in doubt, more is better

## Examples

### Example 1

```python
list("earlobe")
array_of_letters_in_the_word_earlobe = list("earlobe")
```

_Code Explanation:_

**Passive voice:**  
The `list()` constructor ​**is called with**​ a string object with value `"earlobe"` as an argument.  
Local variable `array_of_letters_in_the_word_earlobe` ​**is initialized**​ to reference the return value of the `list()` constructor call.

**Active voice:**  
We are calling the `list()` constructor with the string object `"earlobe"` as an argument. We initialized the variable `array_of_letters_in_the_word_earlobe` with the reference to the return value of calling the `list()` constructor on the string object `"earlobe"`.

### Example 2

```python
number = 5

if number > 0:
    print('This is a positive integer')
```

_Code Explanation:_

On line 1, global variable `number` is initialized and references the integer object `5`. On line 3, an `if` statement is employed, which checks the truthiness of `number > 0`. Because this evaluates as `True`, the `print()` function is invoked with `'This is a positive integer'` as an argument, outputting it to the console.

### Example 3

```python
def add_5(number):
    return number + 5

a = 5
print(add_5(a))
```

_Code Explanation:_

On line 4, local variable `a` is initialized and references the integer object `5`. On line 5, the `add_5` function is invoked and gets passed `a` as an argument, binding its value to the function's parameter `number`. Within the function, the `+` operator evaluates the sum of `number` and `5`, creating the integer `10`. The `return` statement explicitly returns the value `10` from the `add_5` function. This returned value gets passed as an argument to the `print()` function invocation, outputting it to the console.

Note that in Python, values are passed by object reference. When we pass the immutable integer `5` to the function, any operations performed on it within the function won't affect the original variable `a`

### Example 4

```python
def greet(greeting):
    return 'Hello'
    greeting  # This line is never executed

str = 'Goodbye'
print(greet(str))
```

_Code Explanation:_

The code outputs `Hello` due to the explicit `return` statement on line 2. When a `return` statement is executed within a function, the function immediately terminates at that point, returning the value provided with the `return` statement. In this case, `'Hello'` is returned from the `greet` function and is passed to the `print()` function, which outputs it to the console.The line after the `return` statement (`greeting`) is never executed because function execution has already completed. This is known as "unreachable code" - code that appears after a return statement or other flow control statement that guarantees the function will exit before reaching that point.

When preparing for your PY109 assessment, it's important to understand how flow control works in Python functions. As highlighted in the [Study Guide for PY109 Exam](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8), precise language is critical when explaining code behavior. Make sure to clearly identify what a function returns and why it returns that value, especially when control flow statements like `return` affect the execution path.

### Example 5

```python
def countdown(starting_num):
    while True:
        print(starting_num)
        starting_num -= 1
        if starting_num == 0:
            break
    print('Blast off!')

countdown(3)
```

_Code Explanation:_

On line 8, the `countdown` function is invoked and gets passed the integer `3` as an argument, binding it to the function's parameter `starting_num`. Within the function, a `while True` loop is created, which is Python's equivalent of Ruby's `loop do`. Upon each iteration of the loop, the current value of `starting_num` will output using the `print()` function, decrement by `1` with the `-=` operator, then terminate the loop with `break` if its value is `0`. Because its original value is `3`, the loop will execute 3 times, outputting `3`, `2`, `1`, followed by `'Blast off!'` from the `print()` function invocation on line 6.

### Example 6

```python
str = 'cat'

def say():
    str = 'meow'

print(str)
```

_Code Explanation:_

The code outputs `cat`. This is due to Python's variable scoping rules, which dictate that functions have their own local scope. When we assign `str = 'meow'` inside the `say()` function, we're creating a new local variable within the function's scope that happens to have the same name as the global variable. This local variable is separate from the global `str` variable and doesn't affect it.Additionally, the `say()` function is never called in this code. Even if it had been called, the assignment to the local `str` inside the function wouldn't affect the global `str` variable without using the `global` keyword.When the `print(str)` statement executes, it accesses the global `str` variable that was initialized on line 1 with the value `'cat'`, and that's what gets printed.This example illustrates Python's variable scope rules, specifically how variables defined in the global scope cannot be reassigned within a function's local scope without using the `global` keyword.

### Example 7

```python
def question(string):
    string += '?'
    string = string.lower()
    return string

example_string = 'Today is Monday'

question(example_string)

print(example_string)
```

_Code Explanation:_

On Line 6, local variable `example_string` ​_is initialized_​ to reference a string with value `'Today is Monday'`.On Line 8, the `question` function ​_is invoked_​ and the string object ​_referenced_​ by `example_string` ​_is passed_​ in as an argument. The `question` function ​_is defined_​ on lines 1-4. The string object ​_passed_​ in as an argument ​_is bound_​ to function parameter `string`.On Line 2, the `+=` operator ​_is used_​ on the string ​_referenced_​ by function local variable `string`. This operation ​_is equivalent_​ to string concatenation with the string object `'?'` as the right operand. The `+=` operator for strings is non-mutating in Python because strings are immutable. When used, it creates a new string object.Here, the operation concatenates `'?'` to the end of the string object ​_referenced_​ by `string` and ​_creates_​ a new string object `'Today is Monday?'`. The function local variable `string` ​_is reassigned_​ to reference this new string object.On line 3, the `lower()` method ​_is called_​ on the object ​_referenced_​ by `string`. This method ​_returns_​ a new string with all letters converted to lowercase. Unlike Ruby's `downcase!` method, Python's `lower()` is non-mutating because strings in Python are immutable. The function local variable `string` ​_is reassigned_​ to reference this new string object `'today is monday?'`.Since Python functions don't implicitly return the last evaluated expression, a `return` statement ​_is needed_​ on line 4 to explicitly return the value.On line 10, the `print()` function ​_is invoked_​ and ​_passed_​ the object ​_referenced_​ by local variable `example_string`. This line ​_outputs_​ the original string object, with no mutations - `'Today is Monday'`.This code demonstrates an important concept in Python: strings are immutable. While in Ruby the issue was pass-by-value semantics, in Python the immutability of strings means that any operation that appears to "modify" a string actually creates a new string object. The original string object ​_referenced_​ by `example_string` remains unchanged, regardless of what happens inside the function.This is a crucial distinction to understand for the PY109 assessment, as noted in the [Study Guide for PY109 Exam](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8), where precision of language in explaining code behavior is emphasized.

### Example 8

```python
selected_foods = [sub_array for sub_array in [['apple', 'kiwi'], ['artichoke', 'broccoli']] 
                   if [food for food in sub_array if food.startswith('a')]]
print(selected_foods)
```

_Code Explanation:_

On line 1, a list comprehension ​**is used**​ to iterate over a nested list. This comprehension serves as Python's equivalent to Ruby's `select` method. The outer list comprehension iterates over each sublist in the original nested list and ​**binds**​ each sublist to the variable `sub_array`.Inside the comprehension, a conditional expression ​**is used**​ with another nested list comprehension. This nested comprehension ​**checks**​ each string element in the current `sub_array` and ​**selects**​ only those strings that start with 'a'.On line 3, the `startswith()` method ​**is invoked**​ on the string object ​**referenced**​ by the variable `food`, and ​**passed**​ string object `'a'` as an argument. On each iteration, this method call ​_evaluates_​ the calling object and ​_returns_​ a Boolean: `True` if the string begins with 'a', `False` if it doesn't.The inner list comprehension ​_works_​ by selecting those objects for which the condition ​_returns_​ a truthy value and returning them in a new list. (In this case, the inner comprehension will return `['apple']` from the first sublist and `['artichoke']` from the second sublist, filtering out `'kiwi'` and `'broccoli'`).The lists ​**returned**​ by the inner list comprehension become the conditional values for the outer list comprehension. Since each of these returned lists is non-empty (truthy in Python), each iteration of the outer comprehension will add the entire original sublist to the result. On line 1, local variable `selected_foods` ​**is initialized**​ to reference the return value of this nested iteration.On line 3, the `print()` function ​**is invoked**​ and ​**passed**​ the nested list ​**referenced**​ by `selected_foods` as an argument. This function call outputs the nested list to the console.This example demonstrates how Python's list comprehensions can be used to perform selection operations on nested data structures, similar to how nested `select` methods work in Ruby. It also illustrates the Python equivalent of the PEDAC problem-solving process mentioned in the [Study Guide for PY109 Exam](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8), which emphasizes clear reasoning about code execution rather than just listing facts.

### Tips

* Don’t repeat yourself. If you’re describing a block or an iterative structure (like each, select, map, or times), take a bird’s eye view. You’ll waste time and run in circles if you find yourself trying to describe each iteration. Instead step back and verbalize what the iterative structure as a whole is doing.
* Consider whether you’re describing actions being performed by the interpreter (and use passive voice) or by some part of the code (and use active voice). A good rule of thumb: if you can identify who’s responsible for the action, active voice works. If not, default to passive. (What reassigns a variable? Interpreter. Passive. What passes a return value back to a method? A block. Active works.)
* Focus on one method call at a time.
* Try to keep sentences short — one method call, assignment, etc., per sentence helps writing stay clear.
* Use terminology to demonstrate your knowledge, but don’t let it trap you. Saying, “The string object with value `'hello'` referenced by block local variable `string` ..." the first time you encounter the object demonstrates you know how to describe that object. Feeling compelled to use that phrase every single time you refer back to it will make your writing lengthy, time-consuming to write, and harder to read. Once you've demonstrated your knowledge, calling it `'hello'` is fine as long as the context is clear.
* Methods are king. Methods are doing all the heavy lifting, and the method should take precedence in descriptions. A method **is called on** a variable, and **is passed** an argument. As much as possible, orient sentences around describing what the method calls are doing — assignment, reassignment, and argument passing are often happening in response to the method call.
* Integrate descriptions as you go. If you look back at Example 3 above, you can see how explanation is woven is:

	* On line 1 the `#select` method is called on a nested array. A `do...end` block is passed as an argument to the `#select` method call. **On each iteration, a subarray is passed into the the block and is bound to block parameter** `**arr**` **.** On line 2, the `#select` method is called on the subarray **referenced** by block local variable `arr`...

	* Of these four sentences, three are reading the code. The bolded sentence is explanation dropped in at a convenient breaking point, before starting on the next section of code. Explanation can be incorporated like this, but if it’s easier you can also hold off and instead describe at the end.

	* Opting for the incorporated method helps keeps thoughts organized and leads to a shorter description, but it might take a little extra work at first to jump back and forth between reading code and explaining code.
