# Using Collections

## Indexing

- Is the process of using a whole number to access and alter an element of a sequence.
- All sequences, including string, support indexing.
- zero-based numbering is used
- The last index of a sequence is len(seq) - 1
- Negative indexes are used as well

```python
seq = ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(seq[0])  # a (1st element)
print(seq[1])  # b (2nd element)
print(seq[2])  # c (3rd element)
print(seq[3])  # IndexError: tuple index out of range

seq = ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(seq[-1])  # c (last element)
print(seq[-2])  # b (next to last element)
print(seq[-3])  # a (2nd to last element)
```

## Slicing

- **Slicing** augmentation: can extract or modify any number of consecutive elements simultaneously.
- Syntax: `seq[start:stop:step]`
- Negative indexes are also supported
- You get an empty slice when the start and stop values are the same.
- Slicing performs a shallow copy if the sequence contains any collections (lists or tuples).

```python
seq = 'abcdefghi'
print(seq[3:7])       # defg
print(seq[-6:-2])     # defg
print(seq[2:8:2])     # ceg
print(repr(seq[3:3])) # ''
print(seq[:])         # abcdefghi => returns a duplicated sequence
print(seq[::-1])      # ihgfedcba => returns a reverse copy of a sequence

seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(seq[3:7])       # [4, 5, 6, 7]
print(seq[-6:-2])     # [5, 6, 7, 8]
print(seq[2:8:2])     # [3, 5, 7]
print(seq[3:3])       # []
print(seq[:])         # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] => returns a duplicated sequence
print(seq[::-1])      # [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] returns a reverse copy of a sequence

seq = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
seq_dup = seq[:]
print(seq[0] is seq_dup[0])   # True
```

## Key-Based Access

- Mappings use key-based syntax.
- Any hashable object can be used as a key
- When using a non-existent key we get the error `KeyError:`
- `dict.get` method returns the value associated with a given key if they exists, otherwise produces a default return value (usually `None`, but other values can be specified)
- We can assign a new key to the dictionary: `my_dict['key'] = 'value'`
- We cannot use mutable keys.

```python
my_dict = {
    'a': 'abc',
    37: 'def',
    (5, 6, 7): 'ghi',
    frozenset([1, 2]): 'jkl',
}

print(my_dict['a'])                # abc
print(my_dict[37])                 # def
print(my_dict[(5, 6, 7)])          # ghi
print(my_dict[frozenset([1, 2])])  # jkl
print(my_dict['nothing'])     # KeyError: 'nothing'

my_dict = {
    'a': 'abc',
    37: 'def',
    (5, 6, 7): 'ghi',
    frozenset([1, 2]): 'jkl',
}

print(my_dict.get('a'))                 # abc
print(my_dict.get('nothing'))           # None
print(my_dict.get('nothing', 'N/A'))    # N/A
print(my_dict.get('nothing', 100))      # 100
```

## Common Collection Operations

### Non-Mutating Operations for Collections

#### Collection Membership

- The `in` operator determines whether the object to the operator's left is in the iterable collection on the right. Returns `True` if the item is in the collection, `False` otherwise.
- The `not in` operator is the inverse of `in`.
- With sequences and sets, both operators compare the object for equality against each collection element.
- For mappings, it checks whether the item is a key in the dictionary.
- For strings, it determines whether the right string contains the left string.

```python
seq = [4, 'abcdef', (True, False, None)]
print(4 in seq)                         # True
print(4 not in seq)                     # False
print('abcdef' in seq)                  # True
print('abcdef' not in seq)              # False
print('cde' in seq[1])                  # True
print('cde' not in seq[1])              # False
print('acde' in seq[1])                 # False
print('acde' not in seq[1])             # True
print((True, False, None) in seq)       # True
print((True, False, None) not in seq)   # False
print(3.14 in seq)                      # False
print(3.15 not in seq)                  # True
```

#### Minimun and Maximun Members

- `min` and `max` return the minimun and maximum members in an iterable collection.
- Any pair of the collection's elements must be comparable with the `<` and `>` operators.
- In most cases, you can't use `min` and `max` with heterogeneous collections, but it's possible in some situations (int and float)
- You can use them with multiple arguments instead of an iterable.

```python
my_set1 = {1, 4, -9, 16, 25, -36, -63, -1}
my_set2 = {'1', '4', '-9', '16', '25', '-36', '-1'}

print(min(my_set1), max(my_set1))     # -63 25
print(min(my_set2), max(my_set2))     # -1 4
```
```python
>>> my_set = {1, 4, '-9', 16, '25', -36, -63, -1}
>>> min(my_set)
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of
'str' and 'int'

>>> max(my_set)
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of
'str' and 'int'
```
```python
my_set = {1, 3.14, -2.71}
print(min(my_set), max(my_set))      # -2.71 3.14
```

#### Summation

- `sum` function is used with iterable collections which elements are numeric values. It returns the sum of all the collection's numbers.
- `sum` cannot be used with strings

```python
numbers = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
print(sum(numbers))                       # 88
```

#### Locating Indices and Counting

- `seq.index`method returns the index of the first element in the sequence that matches a given object. It raises a `ValueError` exception if the object is not found.
- Also works with strings. It searches for the first matching substring of a string.

```python
names = ['Karl', 'Grace', 'Clare', 'Victor',
         'Antonina', 'Allison', 'Trevor']
print(names.index('Clare'))   # 2
print(names.index('Trevor'))  # 6
print(names.index('Chris'))
# ValueError: 'Chris' is not in list

names = 'Karl Grace Clare Victor Antonina Trevor'
print(names.index('Clare'))   # 11
print(names.index('Trevor'))  # 33
print(names.index('Chris'))
# ValueError: substring not found
```

- `seq.count` returns the number of times a value occurs in the sequence.

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 10, 1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4]
print(numbers.count(1))       # 2
print(numbers.count(3))       # 1
print(numbers.count(4))       # 4
print(numbers.count(7))       # 0
```

#### Merging Collections

- `zip` function merges the members/elements of multiple iterables into a single list of tuples.
- Makes it easy to iterate through many collections simultaneously.
- Each tuple in the list contains objects from each iterable (tuple1 contains all 0-indexed elements, tuple2 contains all 1-indexed elements, tupleN all Nth-indexed elements).
- `zip's` result is a lazy sequence like `range`

```python
iterable1 = [1, 2, 3]
iterable2 = ('Kim', 'Leslie', 'Bertie')
iterable3 = [None, True, False]

zipped_iterables = zip(iterable1, iterable2, iterable3)
print(list(zipped_iterables))
# Pretty printed for clarity
# [
#   (1, 'Kim', None),
#   (2, 'Leslie', True),
#   (3, 'Bertie', False)
# ]
```

- `zip`'s collection arguments don't have to be of the same length. To enforce it, add `strict=True` to raise an exception in that case.

```python
zipped_iterables = zip(iterable1, iterable2, strict=True)
```

- If lengths are different and no `strict=True` is provided: `zip` stops after exhausting the shortest iterable, meaning the number of tuples in the generated list will be determined by the length of the shortest iterable

```python
result = zip(range(5, 10),    # length is 5
             range(1, 3),     # length is 2 (shortest)
             range(3, 7))     # length is 4
print(list(result)) # [(5, 1, 3), (6, 2, 4)]
```
- `zip` returns an iterator, meaning can only be consumed once.

```python
result = zip(range(5, 10),    # length is 5
             range(1, 3),     # length is 2 (shortest)
             range(3, 7))     # length is 4
print(list(result)) # [(5, 1, 3), (6, 2, 4)]
print(list(result)) # []
```

## Nested Collections

- Collections can be nested inside other collections.
- You can't nest a mutable collection inside a set, but you can nest an immutable one: frozenset or tuple.
- You can nest mutable collections inside a tuple and mutate it.

```python
>>> my_set = {1, 2, 3, [4, 5]}
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

>>> my_set = {1, 2, 3, {4, 5}}
TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'

>>> my_set = { 1, 2, 3, frozenset([4, 5]) }
>>> my_set          # {frozenset({4, 5}), 1, 2, 3}

>>> my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, [4, 5], {6, 7}, {'x': 'a dict'})
>>> my_tuple
(1, 2, 3, [4, 5], {6, 7}, {'x': 'a dict'})
```


## Comparing Collections

- Python supports comparison operations for collections. It provides comparison mechanisms for all built-in iterable collections, and you can define comparisons for any custom iterables you create.

-  If two iterables meet all of the following requirements, they are equal. Otherwise, they are unequal:
    - They have the same type: (list, tuple, set, etc.) Note that sets and frozen sets are considered the same for comparison purposes.
    - They have the same number of elements.
    - For sequences, each pair of corresponding elements compares as equal.
    - For sets, each set has the same members (order doesn't matter).
    - For maps, each key/value pair must be present and identical in both maps (order doesn't matter).

```python
print([2, 3] == [2, 3])    # True
print([2, 3] == [3, 2])    # False (diff sequence)
print([2, 3] == [2])       # False (diff lengths)
print([2, 3] == (2, 3))    # False (diff types)
print({2, 3} == {3, 2})    # True (same members)

dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 2, 'a': 1}
dict3 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

print(dict1 == dict2)      # True (same pairs)
print(dict1 == dict3)      # False
```
