# Mappings (Dictionaries)

## Basics

- Maps are types that maintain an **unordered** collection of **key/value** pairs (also called elements or members).
- Maps are accessed by their keys.
- Each key is a unique identifier for a specific object in the mapping.
- The dictionary is the most common mapping in Python.
- Created using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor
- Dictionary or `dict` type.
- Dictionaries are mutable
- Elements are separated by commas. {key:value,...}
- You can access objects in a dict with the `[ ]` key access syntax
- You can use almost any immutable object as a key in a dict; it doesn't have to be a string
- The only significant requirement for keys is that they are hashable. immutable types are almost always hashable, while mutable types are almost always non-hashable.
- Tuples can be used as dictionary keys since they are immutable. However, this only applies if all the elements inside the tuple are also immutable and hashable. For example, a tuple that contains lists cannot be used as a dictionary key since lists are mutable and non-hashable, making the entire tuple non-hashable as well.
- The values in each key/value pair may be any object.

## Creating Dictionaries

```python
# Empty dictionary 
empty_dict = {} 
# Dictionary with initial values 
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'courses': ['Math', 'Science']}
```

## Accessing Values

```python
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
print(student['name'])  # Output: John

# Using get() to avoid KeyError
print(student.get('grade', 'Not Found'))  # Output: Not Found
```

## Modifying Dictionaries

```python
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
# Adding new key-value pairs
student['grade'] = 'A'
# Modifying existing values
student['age'] = 26
```

## Iterating Through Dictionaries

```python
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'grade': 'A'}

# Iterating through keys
for key in student:
    print(key)

# Iterating through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## Dictionary Use Cases

During PY101, you likely used dictionaries for:

1.  Storing related data together  
2.  Creating lookup tables for values  
3.  Counting and tracking occurrences (e.g., character frequency in strings)  
4.  Representing more complex data structures

## Common Patterns with Dictionaries

### 1. Checking if a Key Exists:

```python
if 'name' in student:
    print("Name exists")
```

### 2. Setting default values​: 

```python
# Using get()
value = student.get('grade', 'No grade assigned')

# Using setdefault()
student.setdefault('grade', 'N/A')  # Sets 'grade' to 'N/A' if it doesn't exist
```

### 3. Dictionary comprehensions:

```python
# Create a dictionary of squares
squares = {x: x * x for x in range(6)}  # {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```
