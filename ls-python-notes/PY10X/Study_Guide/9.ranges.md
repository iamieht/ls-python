# Ranges

Are a built-in sequence type in Python used to represent a sequence of numbers.

## Basics

- A `range` object represents an immutable sequence of numbers
- Most commonly used in `for` loops to repeat actions a specific number of times
- Created using the `range()` function
- It's a non-primitive
- **`range(integer)`** doesn't produce the integers before a program ask for it. This optimizes memory. They are lazy sequences.

## Creating ranges

The `range()` function can be called with 1-3 arguments:

- `range(stop)`: Numbers from 0 up to but not including `stop`
- `range(start, stop)`: Numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop`
- `range(start, stop, step)`: Numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop`, incrementing by `step` 

## Key Characteristics

- Ranges are memory-efficient because they don't store all values in memory
- They're immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
- Support standard sequence operations like indexing, slicing, and iteration
- Can be converted to other sequences like lists with `list(range(...))`

## Examples

```python
>>> list(range(1, 10, 2))
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

>>> list(range(0, -5, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4]

# Basic range  
for i in range(5):  
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# With start and stop  
for i in range(2, 7):  
    print(i)  # Prints 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

# With step  
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  
    print(i)  # Prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

# Negative step (counting down)  
for i in range(10, 0, -1):  
    print(i)  # Prints 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```
