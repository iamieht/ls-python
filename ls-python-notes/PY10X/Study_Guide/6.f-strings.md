# Raw Strings and F-Strings

* String literals with an `r` prefix are **raw string literals**. Raw string literals don't recognize escapes, so you can use literal `\` characters freely.

```python
# Both of these print C:\Users\Xyzzy
print("C:\\Users\\Xyzzy")  # Each \\ produces a literal \
print(r"C:\Users\Xyzzy")  # raw string literal
```

* String literals with an `f` are **formatted string literals** or **f-strings**. These enable a way, via **string interpolation**, to embed expressions inside string literals.

```python
>>> f'5 plus 5 equals {5 + 5}.' 
'5 plus 5 equals 10.' 
>>> my_name = 'Karl' 
>>> f'My name is {my_name}.' 
'My name is Karl.' 
>>> my_name = 'Clare' 
>>> greeting = 'Ey up?' 
>>> f'{greeting} My name is {my_name}.' 
'Ey up? My name is Clare.
```

## Basic syntax

F-strings begin with the letter `f` or `F` before the opening quotation mark:

```python
name = "Ivan"  
profession = "programmer"  
greeting = f"Hello, {name}. You are a {profession}."
```

The expressions inside the curly braces `{}` are evaluated at runtime and converted to strings.

## Advantages of F-strings

1.  ​**Readability**​: They're more concise and easier to read than other formatting methods  
2.  ​**Performance**​: F-strings are generally faster than `str.format()` and `%` formatting  
3.  ​**Direct expression evaluation**​: You can put any valid Python expression inside the braces

## Comparison with `str.format()`

```python
name = "Ivan"  
profession = "programmer" 
greeting = "Hello, {}. You are a {}.".format(name, profession)
```

F-strings typically make your code more readable, especially with multiple variables.

## Advanced Features

You can also include formatting specifications within f-strings:

```python
pi = 3.14159  
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
```
