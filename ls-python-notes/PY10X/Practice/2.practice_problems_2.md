# Practice Problems 2

## 1.  What will be the output of this code, and what concept does it demonstrate?

```python
x = 5
y = 2
print(x // y)
print(x / y)
```

## 2.  Analyze this code snippet. What will it print, and what Python feature is being used?

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index + 1}: {fruit}")
```

## 3.  What will be the result of this code, and what concept is it illustrating?

```python
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)
    lst = [1, 2, 3]

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

## 4.  Predict the output of this code and explain the concept it's demonstrating:

```python
x = 10
def func():
    global x
    x = 20
    print(x)

func()
print(x)
```

## 5.  What will this code print, and what Python feature is being used?

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
print(text[::-1])
```

## 6.  Analyze this code. What will it output, and what concept is it demonstrating?

```python
def outer_function(x):
    def inner_function(y):
        return x + y
    return inner_function

closure = outer_function(10)
result = closure(5)
print(result)
```

## 7.  What will be printed by this code, and what Python feature is being used?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(squared)
```

## 8.  Predict the output of this code and explain the concept it's demonstrating:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
print(greet("Bob", "Hi"))
```


## 9.  What will this code print, and what Python feature is being illustrated?

```python
def multiply(*args):
    result = 1
    for num in args:
        result *= num
    return result

print(multiply(2, 3, 4))
```

## 10. Analyze this code snippet. What will it output, and what concept is it demonstrating?

```python
original = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
copied = original.copy()
original["c"] = 3
print(copied)
print(original)
```
