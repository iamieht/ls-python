# Mock Exam # 2

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)
```

**Answer**:

There is no coercion happening in this example.

The reason is that both the values referenced by global variables `a` and `b` are integers, so the expression `a + b` returns an integer as well, in this case `3`.

The `print` function converts the values to strings, to output them, but this is not real coercion.

> **Accuracy: 100/100**  
> Your answer is entirely accurate. You correctly identified that no coercion is happening between the integers in the expression `a + b`. You also accurately noted that while `print()` does convert values to strings internally, this is not considered "real coercion" in the context that we typically discuss it. As the Type Conversions lesson clarifies, while `print()` does convert values to strings behind the scenes, this isn't considered coercion in the programming context since it doesn't affect program flow or return values.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def division(number1, number2):
    numerator = number1
    denominator = number2

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "The denominator cannot be zero"

print(division(5, 0))
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `The denominator cannot be zero`

On line 11, we invoke the function `division` and pass in the values `5` and `0` as arguments.

From lines 1-9, the function `division` is defined and takes 2 arguments `number1` and `number2`.

On line 1, the values `5` and `0` are assigned to the local variables `number1` and `number2`, respectively. 

On line 2, we initialize a local variable `numerator` that references the same value referenced by local variable `number1`, in this case `5`.

On line 3, we initialize a local variable `denominator` that references the same value referenced by local variable `number2`, in this case `0`.

On line 6, inside the `try` block, we initialize a local variable `result` to the result value of the expression `numerator / denominator`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, as the value referenced by `denominator` is `0`. Python stops executing the try-block and jumps to the except handler.

On line 8, the exception is catch and its block executed, returning the string object with value `The denominator cannot be zero` to the caller. This value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function invocation, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is Exception Handling, which is the process to manage or handle errors that might occur during the execution of a program.

> Your answer is entirely accurate. You've correctly identified that the code outputs the string "The denominator cannot be zero". Your line-by-line analysis accurately traces through the execution flow, particularly how the ZeroDivisionError is caught and handled. You've also correctly identified that the key concept demonstrated is Exception Handling.

> Your language is very precise throughout your answer. You correctly use terminology like "references," "local variables," "arguments," "exception," and "exception handler." Your description of how the ZeroDivisionError is raised and caught is technically accurate.One minor point: on line 8, you wrote "the exception is catch" instead of "the exception is caught," but this is clearly a typo rather than a conceptual error.
> 
> Your answer demonstrates a strong understanding of exception handling in Python, which is a key concept covered in PY101. As shown in the [PY101 - Errors](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/378f8121) lesson, the `try`/`except` structure allows programs to gracefully handle errors that might occur during execution, exactly as you've explained.The example you analyzed is particularly relevant because it demonstrates how to handle one of the most common errors in Python programming - the ZeroDivisionError - which occurs "when attempting to divide by zero," as noted in the same lesson.

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

**Answer**

The output is:

`Hello`
`World`

There is a newline or line feed character `\n` present in the string object `Hello\nWorld`, which causes the `print` function to output the string in separate lines.

The concept demonstrated here is escape sequences in strings, which allow us to encode special characters into strings via escape notation that would be impossible to include in another way. Examples: newlines, carriage returns, tabs, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> **Feedback**
> 
> **Accuracy: 98/100**
> 
> Your answer is highly accurate. You correctly identified that the code would output "Hello" and "World" on separate lines due to the `\n` character. You've also properly identified that `\n` is a newline/line feed character, which is correct. The escape sequence `\n` indeed represents a newline character in Python strings.

> Your technical language is precise. You correctly used terms like "newline," "line feed," and "escape sequences." 
> 
> Your explanation aligns with the information from the "Multiline String" exercise which states: "Special characters can be encoded in a string via escape notation... and `\n` is the newline character." 
> 
> This is an important concept in Python string formatting that you'll continue to use throughout your programming journey.The distinction between various escape sequences (`\n` for newline, `\r` for carriage return, `\t` for tab, etc.) demonstrates a strong understanding of string formatting in Python.
