# Mock Exam # 2

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)
```

**Answer**:

There is no coercion happening in this example.

The reason is that both the values referenced by global variables `a` and `b` are integers, so the expression `a + b` returns an integer as well, in this case `3`.

The `print` function converts the values to strings, to output them, but this is not real coercion.

> [!NOTE]
> **Feedback**
> 
> **Accuracy: 100/100**  
> Your answer is entirely accurate. You correctly identified that no coercion is happening between the integers in the expression `a + b`. You also accurately noted that while `print()` does convert values to strings internally, this is not considered "real coercion" in the context that we typically discuss it. As the Type Conversions lesson clarifies, while `print()` does convert values to strings behind the scenes, this isn't considered coercion in the programming context since it doesn't affect program flow or return values.
> 
> **Completeness: 95/100**  
> Your answer is very complete. You addressed all the key aspects of the question:
> 1.  You identified that no coercion occurs in the example  
> 2.  You explained why (both variables are integers)  
> 3.  You addressed what `a + b` returns (integer value 3)  
> 4.  You clarified that the `print()` function's internal string conversion isn't considered coercion.
> 
> The only minor addition that could make it more complete would be explicitly stating that operations between values of the same type in Python don't require coercion.
> 
> **Precision: 95/100**  
> Your language is precise and technically accurate. You:
> •   Correctly used the term "referenced by" when describing how variables relate to values  
> •   Specified that the variables are "global"  
> •   Made the important distinction about the `print()` function's behavior.
> 
> As mentioned in the [Study Guide for PY109 Exam](https://launchschool.com/lessons/1318de4f/assignments/ff1c7aa8), precise language is crucial for assessment questions, and your answer demonstrates this precision.
> 
> Your answer shows a strong understanding of the concept being tested and uses appropriate terminology, which would serve you well in the assessment.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def division(number1, number2):
    numerator = number1
    denominator = number2

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "The denominator cannot be zero"

print(division(5, 0))
```

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```


### 4. What do these print and why?

```python
s1 = "Hello"
print(s1.isalpha()) # True
s2 = "Hello World"
print(s2.isalpha()) # False
s3 = "Hello!"
print(s3.isalpha()) # False
s4 = "Hello123"
print(s4.isalpha()) # False
s5 = ""
print(s5.isalpha()) # False
s6 = "こんにちは"
print(s6.isalpha()) # True
s7 = "HelloWorld"
print(s7.isalpha()) # True
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(all(word.isalpha() for word in words)) # True
```

### 5. What do these print and why?

```python
truthy_values = [1, 2, 3, "hello", [1, 2, 3], {"a": 1}, True, 0, "", [], {}, None, False]

print(“Values:”)
for value in truthy_values:
    if value:
        print(f"{value} is truthy")
    else:
        print(f"{value} is falsy")
```

### 6. What do these print and why?

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15

print(x > 0 and y < 20)
print(not x == y)
print(x < y and y < z)
print(x > y or y > z)
print(not (x > y))
```

### 7. What do these print and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```python
print(range(0,10))
print(len(range(5, 15)))
print(my_range[1])
print(str(range(3, 7)))
print(list(range(12, 8, -1)))
print(list(range(5, 5, 1)))
print(5 in range(5))
print(5 not in range(5, 10))
```

### 8. What does this code print and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```python
example = range(0)
if example:
    print(list(example))
else:
    print(example)
```

### 9. What does this print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
length_of_list = len(my_list)
print("Length of the list:", length_of_list)
```

### 10. What does this print and why?

```python
lst_one = [0, 1, 2, 3]
lst_two = lst_one.append(4)
if lst_two:
    print(lst_two)
else:
    print(lst_one)
```
