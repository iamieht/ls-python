# Mock Exam # 2

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)
```

#### **Answer**:

There is no coercion happening in this example.

The reason is that both the values referenced by global variables `a` and `b` are integers, so the expression `a + b` returns an integer as well, in this case `3`.

The `print` function converts the values to strings, to output them, but this is not real coercion.

> **Accuracy: 100/100**  
> Your answer is entirely accurate. You correctly identified that no coercion is happening between the integers in the expression `a + b`. You also accurately noted that while `print()` does convert values to strings internally, this is not considered "real coercion" in the context that we typically discuss it. As the Type Conversions lesson clarifies, while `print()` does convert values to strings behind the scenes, this isn't considered coercion in the programming context since it doesn't affect program flow or return values.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def division(number1, number2):
    numerator = number1
    denominator = number2

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "The denominator cannot be zero"

print(division(5, 0))
```

#### **Answer**

This code outputs `The denominator cannot be zero`

On line 11, we invoke the function `division` and pass in the values `5` and `0` as arguments.

From lines 1-9, the function `division` is defined and takes 2 arguments `number1` and `number2`.

On line 1, the values `5` and `0` are assigned to the local variables `number1` and `number2`, respectively. 

On line 2, we initialize a local variable `numerator` that references the same value referenced by local variable `number1`, in this case `5`.

On line 3, we initialize a local variable `denominator` that references the same value referenced by local variable `number2`, in this case `0`.

On line 6, inside the `try` block, we initialize a local variable `result` to the result value of the expression `numerator / denominator`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, as the value referenced by `denominator` is `0`. Python stops executing the try-block and jumps to the except handler.

On line 8, the exception is catch and its block executed, returning the string object with value `The denominator cannot be zero` to the caller. This value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function invocation, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is Exception Handling, which is the process to manage or handle errors that might occur during the execution of a program.

> Your answer is entirely accurate. You've correctly identified that the code outputs the string "The denominator cannot be zero". Your line-by-line analysis accurately traces through the execution flow, particularly how the ZeroDivisionError is caught and handled. You've also correctly identified that the key concept demonstrated is Exception Handling.

> Your language is very precise throughout your answer. You correctly use terminology like "references," "local variables," "arguments," "exception," and "exception handler." Your description of how the ZeroDivisionError is raised and caught is technically accurate.One minor point: on line 8, you wrote "the exception is catch" instead of "the exception is caught," but this is clearly a typo rather than a conceptual error.
> 
> Your answer demonstrates a strong understanding of exception handling in Python, which is a key concept covered in PY101. As shown in the [PY101 - Errors](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/378f8121) lesson, the `try`/`except` structure allows programs to gracefully handle errors that might occur during execution, exactly as you've explained.The example you analyzed is particularly relevant because it demonstrates how to handle one of the most common errors in Python programming - the ZeroDivisionError - which occurs "when attempting to divide by zero," as noted in the same lesson.

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

#### **Answer**

The output is:

`Hello`
`World`

There is a newline or line feed character `\n` present in the string object `Hello\nWorld`, which causes the `print` function to output the string in separate lines.

The concept demonstrated here is escape sequences in strings, which allow us to encode special characters into strings via escape notation that would be impossible to include in another way. Examples: newlines, carriage returns, tabs, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> **Feedback**
> 
> **Accuracy: 98/100**
> 
> Your answer is highly accurate. You correctly identified that the code would output "Hello" and "World" on separate lines due to the `\n` character. You've also properly identified that `\n` is a newline/line feed character, which is correct. The escape sequence `\n` indeed represents a newline character in Python strings.

### 4. What do these print and why?

```python
s1 = "Hello"
print(s1.isalpha()) # True
s2 = "Hello World"
print(s2.isalpha()) # False
s3 = "Hello!"
print(s3.isalpha()) # False
s4 = "Hello123"
print(s4.isalpha()) # False
s5 = ""
print(s5.isalpha()) # False
s6 = "こんにちは"
print(s6.isalpha()) # True
s7 = "HelloWorld"
print(s7.isalpha()) # True
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(all(word.isalpha() for word in words)) # True
```

#### **Answer**

On line 2, the output is `True`. On line 1, we initialize a global variable `s1` that references a string object with value `Hello`. On line 2, the method `isalpha()` is invoked on the object referenced by `s1`. This method returns `True` if all string characters are alphabetic, which is the case here.

On line 4, the output is `False`. On line 3, we initialize a global variable `s2` that references a string object with value `Hello World`. On line 4, we invoke the method `isalpha()` on `s2`, returning `False` as there is a space character between the string `Hello` and `World`.

On line 6, the output is `False`. On line 5, we initialize a global variable `s3` that references the value `Hello!`. When invoking the `isalpha()` method on the object referenced by `s3`, the return value is `False` because of the character `!`, which is not alphabetic.

On line 8, the output is `False`. On line 7, we initialize a global variable `s4` that references the value `Hello123`. When invoking the `isalpha()` method on the object referenced by `s4`, the return value is `False` because of the characters `123`, which are not alphabetic.

On line 10, the output is `False`. On line 9, we initialize a global variable `s5` to an empty string. When invoking the `isalpha()` method on the object referenced by `s5`, the return value is `False`, as there are no characters in the string.

On line 12, the output is `True`. On line 11, we initialize a global variable `s6` to the string `こんにちは`. As all these characters are alphabetic, the method `isalpha()` returns `True`.

On line 14, the output is `True`. On line 13, we initialize a global variable `s7` to the string `HelloWorld`. As all these characters are alphabetic, the `isalpha()` method returns `True`.

On line 16, the output is `True`. On line 15, we initialize a global variable `words` to a list object with 3 elements `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`. On line 16, we have a generator expression that returns `True` for each element of the list, as all are alphabetic characters. These return values are then passed in as an argument to the `all` function that returns `True`, as all elements of the iterable are `True`.

The concept demonstrated here is string check methods, specifically `isalpha()` that check that the string contains only alphabetic characters, without modifying the original string, demonstrating string immutability.

> **Feedback**
> 
> **Accuracy: 99/100**
> 
> Your answer is highly accurate. You've correctly explained the behavior of the `isalpha()` method for each string example. Your explanation of how it returns `True` only when all characters in a string are alphabetic is correct. You've also accurately analyzed each case, including the empty string, strings with spaces, punctuation, numbers, and non-ASCII characters.The only very minor issue is that on line 15, the variable is named `words` in the code, not `s8` as you referred to it.

> Your technical language is very precise. You correctly use terms like "references," "method," "invoked," "global variable," and "generator expression." Your explanation of how the `isalpha()` method works is technically accurate.Your discussion of string immutability is particularly noteworthy. 
> 
> As discussed in the [Clean up the words](https://launchschool.com/exercises/f2e7ee97) exercise documentation, understanding character properties and string manipulation is important in Python. The `isalpha()` method is one of several string methods that checks character properties without modifying the original string, which demonstrates the immutable nature of strings in Python.Additionally, your explanation of how `all()` works with a generator expression shows a good understanding of functional programming concepts in Python.

> Overall, this is an excellent analysis that demonstrates a solid understanding of string methods and their behavior in Python. This level of detail and precision would be very appropriate for your assessment.

### 5. What do these print and why?

```python
truthy_values = [1, 2, 3, "hello", [1, 2, 3], {"a": 1}, True, 0, "", [], {}, None, False]

print(“Values:”)
for value in truthy_values:
    if value:
        print(f"{value} is truthy")
    else:
        print(f"{value} is falsy")
```

#### **Answer**:

This code outputs:

`Values:`
`1 is truthy`
`2 is truthy`
`3 is truthy`
`hello is truthy`
`[1, 2, 3] is truthy`
`{'a': 1} is truthy`
`True is truthy`
`0 is falsy`
 `is falsy`
`[] is falsy`
`{} is falsy`
`None is falsy`
`False is falsy`

The reason of the output is that in Python the following values are falsy: `0, "", [], {}, None, False` and everything else is truthy.

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `truthy_values` that referenced a list object with the following elements: `1, 2, 3, "hello", [1, 2, 3], {"a": 1}, True, 0, "", [], {}, None, False`.

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function with the string object `Values:` as an argument, which outputs it to the console.

On line 4, we have a `for` loop that iterates over each element in `truthy_values` and assign it to the local variable `value`.

On line 5, we have a conditional statement that checks for truthiness on the value referenced by `value`. If the value is truthy, line 6 is executed. On this line, we have an f-string denoted by the prefix `f` on the string and the expression `value`, which is evaluated at runtime, inside curly braces. The string is passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs the correspondent value interpolated into the string and `is truthy` to the console.

If the value is falsy, the string is passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs the correspondent value interpolated into the string and `is falsy` to the console.

The concept demonstrated here is Truthiness, which is how values evaluate in a Boolean context (conditional statements), regardless of whether they are actual Boolean values.

> •   Other empty collections
> 
> The Study Guide for PY109 Exam emphasizes the importance of being very clear about the distinction between truthy/falsy values and the boolean values `True` and `False`. Your answer demonstrates this distinction well, explaining how values evaluate in boolean contexts without equating them to `True` or `False`.This understanding of truthiness is fundamental in Python and will be crucial for your assessment. Your explanation shows a solid grasp of this concept.
