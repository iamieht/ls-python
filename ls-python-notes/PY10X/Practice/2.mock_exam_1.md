# Mock Exam 1

### 1: Which variable is coerced? Is it implicit or explicit coercion?

```python
x = 3.5
y = 5
z = x + y
```

#### **Answer:**

The value of the variable y is implicitly coerced into a float number.

On line 1, we initialize the global variable  `x` that references a float object with the value `3.5`

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `y` that references an integer object with the value `5`.

On line 3, we initialize a global variable `z` that references the return value of adding `x + y`, which results in `8.5`.

In this code snippet, the coercion of the value referenced by `y` happens because there is a calculation (addition) that involves both an integer value and a float value. Python implicitly coerces the integer value to a float, returning a float value.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def convert_to_int(string):
    try:
        converted_integer = int(string)
        return converted_integer
    except ValueError:
        return "That string cannot be converted to an integer"

print(convert_to_int("hello"))

print(convert_to_int("5"))
```

#### **Reviewed Answer**:

This code snippet returns on line 8, the string object with the value `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. And on line 10, the integer object with value `5`.

On line 8, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `hello` as an argument.

From lines 1-6, we have the definition of the function `convert_to_int` with a single parameter `string`.

Within the function, the value `hello` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the built-in type conversion function `int` and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. This explicit coercion raises a `ValueError` exception, as the string `hello` cannot be transformed into an integer object. This exception is caught in the `except` statement, executing the respective code block, returning the string `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. The returned value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 10, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `5` as an argument.

Within the function, the value `5` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the built-in type conversion function `int` and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. The explicit coercion to an integer object is successful and the returned value is assigned to the variable `converted_integer`, which is then returned on line 4 and passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of Explicit Type Coercion, which is when we intentionally transform the value of a data type into another with the use of built-in functions, in this case the built-in function `int()`, to transform a value with data type string to integer.

Additionally, the concept of Exception Handling is demonstrated by the use of try/except statements to catch runtime exceptions to avoid breaking the program flow.

### 3. What is the output of this code, and why? What is the concept covered here?

```python
str1 = "Hello, world!"
sub1 = str1[8:12]
print(sub1)
sub2 = str1[::-1]
print(sub2)
sub3 = str1[::2]
print(sub3)
```

#### **Answer**:

The output of this code is:

`orld`
`!dlrow ,olleH`
`Hlo ol!`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `str1` that references a string object with the value `Hello, world!`.

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `sub1` that references the return value of slicing the value reference by `str1` from the element located at index 8 up to but not including the element at index 12. The return value is a new string object with value `orld`.

On line 3, we pass in the value referenced by `sub1` to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 4, we initialize a global variable `sub2` that references the return value of slicing the string object referenced by `str1`, in reverse mode, returning a new string object with value  `!dlrow ,olleH`.

On line 5, we invoke the `print` function with the value referenced by `sub2` as an argument, outputting it to the console.

On line 6, we initialize a global variable `sub3` that references the return value of slicing the string object referenced by `str1`, with a step of 2, returning a new string object with value `Hlo ol!`, which is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is string slicing and string immutability, as when slicing a string, a new string object is returned.

### 4. What does this print and why, what is the concept?

```python
name = 'Abraham Lincoln'
print(f"{name} was a President of the US")
```

#### **Reviewed Answer**:

The output of this code is the string `Abraham Lincoln was a President of the US`.

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `name` that references a string object with the value `'Abraham Lincoln'`.

On line 2, we use an f-string (formatted string literal) which is denoted by the `f` prefix before the string. The expression `{name}` within the curly braces is evaluated at runtime, and the value of the `name` variable (`'Abraham Lincoln'`) is converted to a string and inserted into that position. This complete string is then passed as an argument to the `print()` function, which outputs `Abraham Lincoln was a President of the US` to the console.

The concept demonstrated here is string interpolation using f-strings, which were introduced in Python 3.6 as a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals. f-strings automatically handle the conversion of non-string values to strings.

### 5. What does this print and why?

```python
mashup = "thIs is How we type careLEssly"
cleaned = mashup.capitalize()
print(cleaned)
```

#### **Answer**:

This code prints: `This is how we type carelessly`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `mashup` that references a string object with the value `thIs is How we type careLEssly`.

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `cleaned` to the return value of invoking the `capitalize()` method on the value referenced by `mashup`. The `capitalize()` method returns a new string object with the first character of the string uppercased and the rest of the characters lowercased, resulting in the value `This is how we type carelessly`.

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the value referenced by `cleaned`, outputting it to the console.

### 6. What do these print and why?

```python
stuff = 'tHIS iS bACKWARDS'
str1 = stuff.swapcase()
str2 = stuff.upper()
str3 = stuff.lower()
print(stuff)
print(str1)
print(str2)
print(str3)
```

#### **Answer**:

This code prints:

`tHIS iS bACKWARDS`
`This Is Backwards`
`THIS IS BACKWARDS`
`this is backwards`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `stuff` that references a string object with the value `tHIS iS bACKWARDS`

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `str1` that references the return value of invoking the `swapcase()` method on the object referenced by `stuff`. The method returns a new string object with the characters cased swap, if uppercased, then returns it lowercased and vice versa. The return value is `This Is Backwards`.

On line 3, we initialize a global variable `str2` that references the return value of invoking the method `upper()` on the value referenced by `stuff`, resulting in a new string object with the value `THIS IS BACKWARDS`. The `upper()` method returns a new string object with all the characters uppercased.

On line 4, we initialize a global variable `str3` that references the return value of invoking the method `lower()` on the the object referenced by `stuff`, resulting in a new string object with the value `this is backwards`. The `lower()` method returns a new string object with all the characters lowercased.

On line 5, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the value referenced by `stuff`, which outputs it to the console.

On line 6, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the value referenced by `str1`, which outputs it to the console.

On line 7, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the value referenced by `str2`, which outputs it to the console.

On line 8, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the value referenced by `str3`, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is string methods, specifically `swapcase()`, `upper()` and `lower()` and how these methods return a new string object as strings are immutable.

### 7. What do these print and why?

```python
a = 10
b = 20

print(a < b < 30)
print(a > b or b == 20)
```

**Answer**:

This code prints:

`True`
`True`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `a` that references an integer object with value `10`

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `b` that references an integer object with value `20`

On line 4, the expression `a < b < 30` is evaluated as follows: the left operand `(a < b)` and the right operand `(b < 30)`. As the value referenced by `a` is less than the value referenced by `b`, this evaluates to `True` and as the value referenced by `b` is less that `30`, this evaluates to `True` as well, resulting in `True`the whole expression evaluation. This value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 5, the expression `a > b or b == 20` is evaluated as follows: the left operand evaluates to `False` as `10` is less than `20` and the right operand evaluates to `True` as `20` is equal to `20`. The whole expression evaluates to `True`. This value is passed in an an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

There is no short-circuit evaluation happening in either expressions as the whole expression have to be evaluated to determined the resulting value.

Also, the comparison operator `<` and `==` have precedence over the logical operators `or` and `and`.

The concept demonstrated here is Truthiness and logical operators.

**Reviewed Answer**:

This code prints:

`True`
`True`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `a` that references an integer object with value `10`

On line 2, we initialize a global variable `b` that references an integer object with value `20`

On line 4, the expression `a < b < 30` is a chained comparison and is evaluated as `a < b and b < 30`. The left operand `(a < b)` evaluates to `True`, as the value `10` is less than the value `20`, and the right operand `(b < 30)` evaluates to `True`, as `20` is less than `30`, resulting in `True`the whole expression evaluation. This value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 5, the expression `a > b or b == 20` is evaluated as follows: the left operand evaluates to `False` as `10` is less than `20` and the right operand evaluates to `True` as `20` is equal to `20`. The whole expression evaluates to `True`. This value is passed in an an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

There is no short-circuit evaluation happening in either expressions as the whole expression have to be evaluated to determined the resulting value.

Also, the comparison operator `<` and `==` have precedence over the logical operators `or` and `and`.

The concept demonstrated here is Truthiness and logical operators.

### 8. What does this print and why?

```python
name = 'John'

def greet():
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet()
```

**Answer**:

This code outputs `Hello, John!`

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `name` that references a string object with value `John`.

On line 6, we invoke the `greet()`function.

From lines 3-4, the `greet` function is defined with no parameters.

Within the function, on line 4, we use an f-string (formatted string literal) which is denoted by the `f` prefix before the string. The expression `{name}` within the curly braces is evaluated at runtime, and the value of the `name` variable (`'John'`) is converted to a string and interpolated into the string. This complete string is then passed as an argument to the `print()` function, which outputs `Hello, John!` to the console.

The concept demonstrated is string interpolation (f-strings) and global variable scope, in which a variable initialized in an outer scope is accessible anywhere in the program.

### 9. What does this print and why?

```python
def assign():
    var = 20
    print(var)

assign()
```

**Answer**:

This code prints `20`

On line 5, we invoke the function `assign` with no arguments.

From lines 1-3, the function `assign` is defined with no parameters.

Within the function, on line 2, we initialize a local variable `var` that references an integer object with value `20`.

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function and pass in the value referenced by `var` as an argument, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated here is local variable scope , in which variables defined inside a function can only be accessed within that function.

### 10. What does this print and why?

```python
try:
    print(var)
except NameError as e:
    print("Error occurred")
```

**Answer**:

This code prints `Error occurred`.

The reason is that when invoking the `print`function inside the `try` block, the variable `var` is undefined, raising a `NameError` exception. The except clause catches the exception as `e` and executes its block. Within the block we invoke the `print` function and pass in the string object with value `Error occurred` as an argument, which outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is Exception Handling, which allows the program flow to continue without crashing the program.

> 1.  Your output prediction is correct: `Error occurred`  
> 2.  You correctly identified that `var` is undefined, which raises a `NameError`  
> 3.  You accurately explained how the exception is caught and handled in the except block  
> 4.  You identified the concept being demonstrated: Exception Handling  
> 5.  You correctly noted the purpose of exception handling: allowing program flow to continue without crashing

> **Areas for Minor Enhancement**​:
> 1.  You could mention that the variable `e` captures the actual exception object, which contains information about the error, though it's not used in this example  
> 2.  For completeness, you could explain that Python's exception handling structure includes optional `else` and `finally` blocks (though they aren't used here)Your answer shows a good understanding of one of Python's fundamental error handling mechanisms.

> As explained in the [PY101 - Errors](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/378f8121) lesson, exception handling in Python follows this structure:
> 1.  The code that might raise an exception is placed in a `try` block  
> 2.  When an exception occurs, Python looks for a matching `except` block  
> 3.  If found, the code in that block executes instead of crashing the programThis is precisely what happens in the example—the undefined variable triggers a `NameError`, which is caught by the matching except clause.

> Overall, your answer demonstrates a solid grasp of exception handling in Python, which is an important concept for writing robust programs.
