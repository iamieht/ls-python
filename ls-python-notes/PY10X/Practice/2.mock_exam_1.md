### 1: Which variable is coerced? Is it implicit or explicit coercion?

```python
x = 3.5
y = 5
z = x + y
```

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def convert_to_int(string):
    try:
        converted_integer = int(string)
        return converted_integer
    except ValueError:
        return "That string cannot be converted to an integer"

print(convert_to_int("hello"))

print(convert_to_int("5"))
```
