# Mock Exam 1

### 1: Which variable is coerced? Is it implicit or explicit coercion?

```python
x = 3.5
y = 5
z = x + y
```

**Answer**:

The variable `y` is coerced into a float number and the value of `z` is `8.5`

The Python interpreter does an implicit coercion of the variable `y`.

There are two types of coercion in Python, implicit and explicit. Implicit is when the Python interpreter does it behind the scenes and explicit is when we intentionally use a built-in function to change the data type from one type to another. For example via the constructors `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

**Reviewed Answer:**

The value of the variable y is implicitly coerced into a float number.

On line 1, we initialize the global variable x that references a float object with the value 3.5

On line 2, we initialize a global variable y that references an integer object with the value 5.

On line 3, we initialize a global variable z that references the return value of adding x + y, which results in 8.5.

In this code snippet, the coercion of the value referenced by y happens because there is a calculation (addition) that involves both an integer value and a float value. Python implicitly coerces the integer value to a float, returning a float value.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def convert_to_int(string):
    try:
        converted_integer = int(string)
        return converted_integer
    except ValueError:
        return "That string cannot be converted to an integer"

print(convert_to_int("hello"))

print(convert_to_int("5"))
```

**Answer**:

This code snippet returns on line 8, the string object with the value `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. And on line 10, the integer object with value `5`.

On line 8, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `hello` as an argument.

From lines 1-6, we have the definition of the function `convert_to_int` with a single parameter `string`.

Within the function, the value `hello` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the `int` constructor and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. This explicit coercion raises a `ValueError` exception, as the string `hello` cannot be transformed into an integer object. This exception is caught in the `except` statement, executing the respective code block, returning the string `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. The returned value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 10, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `5` as an argument.

Within the function, the value `5` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the `int` constructor and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. The explicit coercion to an integer object is successful and the returned value is assigned to the variable `converted_integer`, which is then returned on line 4 and passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of Explicit Type Coercion, which is when we intentionally transform the value of a data type into another with the use of built-in functions, in this case the built-in function `int()`, to transform a value with data type string to integer.

Additionally, the concept of Exception Handling is demonstrated by the use of try/except statements to catch runtime exceptions to avoid breaking the program flow.

**Reviewed Answer**:

This code snippet returns on line 8, the string object with the value `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. And on line 10, the integer object with value `5`.

On line 8, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `hello` as an argument.

From lines 1-6, we have the definition of the function `convert_to_int` with a single parameter `string`.

Within the function, the value `hello` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the built-in type conversion function `int` and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. This explicit coercion raises a `ValueError` exception, as the string `hello` cannot be transformed into an integer object. This exception is caught in the `except` statement, executing the respective code block, returning the string `That string cannot be converted to an integer`. The returned value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

On line 10, we invoke the function `convert_to_int` with the string object with value `5` as an argument.

Within the function, the value `5` is assigned to the local variable `string`. We have a `try` statement and within the block we invoke the built-in type conversion function `int` and pass in the value referenced by `string` as an argument. The explicit coercion to an integer object is successful and the returned value is assigned to the variable `converted_integer`, which is then returned on line 4 and passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of Explicit Type Coercion, which is when we intentionally transform the value of a data type into another with the use of built-in functions, in this case the built-in function `int()`, to transform a value with data type string to integer.

Additionally, the concept of Exception Handling is demonstrated by the use of try/except statements to catch runtime exceptions to avoid breaking the program flow.
