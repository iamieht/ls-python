# Mock Exam #3

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
month = "December"
day = int(input("What day is it? "))
print(f"Today is the {day} of {month}")
```

#### Answer

In this code snippet we can see both explicit and implicit coercion.

On line 1, a global variable `month` is initialized and references a string object with the value `December`.

On line 2, a global variable `day`is initialized and references the return value of the expression `int(input("What day is it? "))`. The `input` function is invoked with the string object `What day is it? `as an argument. The argument is written into the standard output without a trailing newline and then reads a line from the input, converts it into a string (stripping a trailing newline) and returns it. The `int` built-in function coerces explicitly the returned value from string to an integer and the return value is then assigned to the variable `day`. If the user inputs a non-numeric value, the `int()` function raises a `ValueError`. 

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument a formatted string or f-string. At runtime, the values referenced by variables `day` and `month`, are automatically coerced by Python using the built-in `str()` function, and interpolated into the string `Today is the {day} of {month}`, which is output into the console. The `print` function outputs a string, but this is not considered a coercion, even though it coerces its arguments into strings, it doesn't return the strings, only prints them.

### 2: What does this print and why, what concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def addition(number1, number2):
    number1 += number2

x = 1
y = 2

addition(x, y)
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```

#### Answer

This code outputs `x is 1, y is 2`.

On line 4, a global variable `x` is initialized and references an integer object with value `1`.

On line 5, a global variable `y` is initialized and references an integer object with value `2`.

On line 7, we invoke the function `addition` and pass in the values referenced by `x` and `y` as an argument.

On lines 1-2, the `addition` function is defined with 2 parameters, `number1` and `number2`.

On line 2, inside the function, a local variable `number1` is reassigned to the return value of adding the value referenced by `number2` and `number1`, which is `3`. This code shortcut is knowns as augmented assignment. This reassignment has no impact on the global variables, as a new local variable is created rather than mutating the passed in values. The `+=` operator on immutable objects like integers creates a new object rather than modifying the existing one. This also demonstrates the immutability of integers in Python, once they are created, they cannot be modified.

On line 8, we have a formatted-string or f-string, denoted by the prefix `f` before the string. The values referenced by `x` and `y` are interpolated into the string at runtime, and implicitly coerced into a string by using the `str` built-in function. The return value is then passed in as an argument to the `print` function, which outputs it into the console. The `print` function coerces the values into strings, but this is technically not a coercion as it happens behind the scenes and have no impact on the return values.

The concept demonstrated is variable scope and how the assignment inside a function creates a local variable to the function rather than mutating the variables initialized in the outer scope. It also demonstrates the concept of Pass-by-object-reference, when `x` and `y` are passed to the function, the parameters `number1` and `number2` become references to the same objects that `x` and `y` refer to.

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept does this cover? How would you refactor this to remove the space?

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2))
```

#### Answer

This code outputs `14 20`

The `print` function is invoked and gets passed two arguments. The first one is the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, which evaluates to `14` as multiplication has precedence over addition, so the right operand `3 * 4` is evaluated first, resulting in `12`, which is then added to `2`, outputting `14` to the console. The second argument is the expression `4 * (3 + 2)`, in which the right operand `(3 + 2)` is evaluated first as parenthesis have the greater precedence, returning `5`, which is then multiplied by `4`, resulting in `20`, which is output into the console. The default separator of the `print()` function is a space, reason why we see an space between the values `14` and `20`.

The concept demonstrated here is operator precedence and how parenthesis have greater precedence, then `**`, then `*` and `/` and then `+` and `-`.

To remove the space

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2), sep = '')
print(f"{2 + 3 * 4}{4 * (3 + 2)}")
```

### 4. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
name = 'Alexander Graham Bell'
print(name[0])
```

#### Answer

This code outputs `A`

On line 1, a global variable `name` is initialized and references a string object with the value `Alexander Graham Bell`.

On line 2, we invoke the `print()` function with the expression `name[0]` as an argument. The expression uses string indexing to access the first character (at index `0`) of the value referenced by `name`, which is `A`. The `print()` function then outputs it to the console.

The concept demonstrated is string indexing, and how individual characters can be accessed from a string using zero-based index notation. Strings are sequence types in Python, which means they support indexing operations like the one shown. Strings are immutable, meaning that while we can access individual characters, we cannot modify them.

### 5. What does this print and why?

```python
string1 = "HelloWorld"
string2 = "12345"
string3 = "Hello World"

result1 = string1.isalpha()
result2 = string2.isalpha()
result3 = string3.isalpha()

print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string1), result1)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string2), result2)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string3), result3)
```

#### Answer

This code outputs:

`Is 'HelloWorld' alphabetic? True`
`Is '12345' alphabetic? False`
`Is 'Hello World' alphabetic? False`

On line 1, a global variable `string1` is initialized and references a string object with value `HelloWorld`.

On line 2, a global variable `string2` is initialized and references a string object with value `12345`.

On line 3, a global variable `string3` is initialized and references a string object with value `Hello World`.

On line 5, a global variable `result1` is initialized and references the return value of invoking the `isalpha()` method on the value referenced by `string1`. The value `True` is returned as the method `isalpha()` returns `True` if all characters of the string are alphabetic, which is the case for the string `HelloWorld`.

On line 6, a global variable `result2` is initialized and references the return value of invoking the `isalpha()` method on the value referenced by `string2`. The value `False` is returned as the method `isalpha()` returns `False` if any character of the string is not alphabetic, which is the case for the string `12345`.

On line 7, a global variable `result3` is initialized and references the return value of invoking the `isalpha()` method on the value referenced by `string3`. The value `False` is returned as there is a space present in the string `Hello World`, which is not an alphabetic character.

On line 8, the `print` function is invoked with two arguments. In the first argument, the `format` method is called on the string with value `Is '{}' alphabetic?` with the value referenced by `string1` as an argument. The `format` method interpolates the value referenced by `string1`into the string, resulting in the string object with value `Is 'HelloWorld' alphabetic?`. The second argument is the variable `result1`, which outputs `True`to the console.

On lines 9 and 10, the behavior is similar as line 8, but replacing the values with those referenced by the variables `string2`, `result2` and `string3`, `result3` respectively.

The concept demonstrated is string methods, specifically `isalpha()` method and how can we test for character properties, in this case if all characters are alphabetical (A-Z, a-z).

### 6. What do these print and why?

```python
s1 = "123abc"
print(s1.isdigit())
s2 = "123$%^"
print(s2.isdigit())
s3 = ""
print(s3.isdigit())
s4 = "12345"
print(s4.isdigit())
```

#### Answer

The output of this code is:

`False`
`False`
`False`
`True`

On line 1, a global variable `s1` is initialized and references a string object with value `123abc`.

On line 2, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of invoking the `isdigit()` method on the value referenced by `s1`, which is output into the console. The `isdigit()` method returns `False` as the characters `abc` of the string are not digits.

On line 3, a global variable `s2` is initialized and references a string object with value `123$%^`.

On line 4, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of invoking the `isdigit()` method on the value referenced by `s2`, which is output into the console. The `isdigit()` method returns `False` as the characters `$%^`of the string are not digits.

On line 5, a global variable `s3` is initialized and references an empty string.

On line 6, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of invoking the `isdigit()` method on the value referenced by `s3`, which is output into the console. The `isdigit()` method returns `False` as an empty string has no digits.

On line 7, a global variable `s4` is initialized and references a string object with value `12345`.

On line 8, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of invoking the `isdigit()` method on the value referenced by `s4`, which is output into the console. The `isdigit()` method returns `True` as all the characters of the string are digits.

The concept demonstrated is string methods that can be used to test character properties, and `isdigit()` specifically tests whether a string consists entirely of digit characters.

### 7. What do these print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in my_list)
print(6 not in my_list)
```

#### Answer

This code outputs:

`True`
`True`

On line 1, a global variable `my_list` is initialized and references a list object with 5 elements: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

On line 2, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of the expression `3 in my_list`, which returns `True`, as the element `3` is a member of the list object referenced by `my_list`. The returned value is output into the console.

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument the return value of the expression `6 not in my_list`, which returns `True`, as the element `6` is not a member of the list object referenced by `my_list`. The returned value is output into the console.

The concept demonstrated is the membership operator `in` and `not in` and how they are used to test whether a value is found in a sequence

### 8. What do these print and why?

```python
temperature = 25
time_of_day = "morning"

if temperature < 30 and (time_of_day == "morning" or time_of_day == "afternoon"):
    print("It's a pleasant day!")
else:
    print("It's either too hot or not the right time of day.")
```

#### Answer

The output of this code is `It's a pleasant day!`

On line 1, a global variable `temperature` is initialized and references an integer object with the value `25`

On line 2, a global variable `time_of_day` is initialized and references a string object with the value `morning`

On line 4, we have a conditional statement that checks for truthiness of the whole expression, which evaluates as `True`. The reason is the left operand evaluates to `True` as the value referenced by `temperature`, 25, is less than `30`. The right operand evaluates to `True` as well, as the expression `time_of_day == "morning" or time_of_day == "afternoon"` short-circuits, as the left operand `time_of_day == "morning"` evaluates to `True` and there is not need to evaluate the rest of the expression as we are using the `or` operator, which short-circuits if the left operand is `truthy`.

Within the `if` branch, we call the `print` function and pass in as an argument the string object with value `It's a pleasant day!`, which is then output into the console.

### 9. What does this code print and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def number_range(number):
    match number:
        case n if n < 0:
            print(f'{number} is less than 0')
        case n if n <= 50:
            print(f'{number} is between 0 and 50')
        case n if 50 < n <= 100:
            print(f'{number} is between 51 and 100')
        case _:
            print(f'{number} is greater than 100')
number_range(0)
number_range(25)
```

#### Answer

This code outputs:

`0 is between 0 and 50`
`25 is between 0 and 50`

From lines 1-10 the function `number_range`is defined with a single parameter `number`.

On line 11, we invoke the function `number_range` with the integer `0` as an argument.

Within the function, on line 2, we have a `match` statement that evaluates the `number` parameter. 

On line 3, the `case` statement is evaluated with the `if` guard clause `n < 0`. As this evaluates as `False`, as `0` is not less than `0`, the branch is not executed.

On line 5, the `case` statement is evaluated. The expression `if n <= 50` evaluates as `True`, as `0` is less than or equal to `50`, then the branch is executed. On line 6, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument a formatted-string or f-string, denoted by the prefix `f`, which coerces into a string using the built-in function `str` the value referenced by `number` and interpolates it into the string, resulting in the string object with value `0 is between 0 and 50`, which is then output into the console.

On line 12, we invoke the function `number_range` with the integer `25` as an argument.

Within the function, on line 2, we have a `match` statement that evaluates the `number` parameter. 

On line 3, the `case` statement is evaluated with the `if` guard clause `n < 0`. As this evaluates as `False`, as `25` is not less than `0`, the branch is not executed.

On line 5, the `case` statement is evaluated. The expression `if n <= 50` evaluates as `True`, as `25` is less than or equal to `50`, then the branch is executed. On line 6, we invoke the `print` function and pass in as an argument a formatted-string or f-string, denoted by the prefix `f`, which coerces into a string using the built-in function `str` the value referenced by `number` and interpolates it into the string, resulting in the string object with value `25 is between 0 and 50`, which is then output into the console.

The concept demonstrated here are conditionals using the match/case statement.

> 
> Overall, this is a strong answer that shows you understand how the `match-case` statement works in Python. The `match-case` statement is a powerful feature added in Python 3.10 that provides a more elegant way to implement complex conditional logic compared to traditional `if-elif-else` chains.

### 10. What does this print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ele = my_list.pop()
print("Popped element:", ele)
print("List after popping:", my_list)
ele1 = my_list.pop(1)
print("Popped element at index 1:", ele1)
print("Modified list after popping at index 1:", my_list)
```

#### Answer

This code outputs:

`Popped element: 5`
`List after popping: [1, 2, 3, 4]`
`Popped element at index 1: 2`
`Modified list after popping at index 1: [1, 3, 4]`

On line 1, a global variable `my_list` is initialized and references a list object with 5 elements: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

On line 2, a global variable `ele` is initialized and references the returned value of invoking the `pop` method without argument on the value referenced by `my_list`. The `pop` method without argument, returns the last element of the list, which in this case is `5`.

On line 3, we invoke the `print`function and pass in two arguments. The string object `Popped element:` and the variable `ele`, outputting them to the console.

On line 4, we invoke the `print` function and pass in two arguments. The string object `List after popping:` and the variable `my_list`, outputting them to the console. As the object referenced by `my_list` was mutated, the current elements referenced by `my_list` are `[1, 2, 3, 4].

On line 5, a global variable `ele1` is initialized and references the return value of invoking the `pop` method with the integer `1` as an argument, which represents the element located at index `1`, which in this case is `2`.

On line 6, we invoke the `print` function and pass in two arguments. The string object with value `Popped element at index 1:` and the variable `ele1`, which references the value `2`, outputting them into the console.

On line 7, we invoke the `print` function and pass in two arguments. The string object with value `Modified list after popping at index 1:` and the variable `my_list`.  As the object referenced by `my_list` was mutated, the current elements referenced by `my_list` are `[1, 3, 4].
