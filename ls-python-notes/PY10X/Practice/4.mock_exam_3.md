# Mock Exam #3

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
month = "December"
day = int(input("What day is it? "))
print(f"Today is the {day} of {month}")
```

#### Answer

In this code snippet we can see both explicit and implicit coercion.

On line 1, a global variable `month` is initialized and references a string object with value `December`.

On line 2, the `input` function is invoked and gets passed in the string object with value `What day is it? ` as an argument. The `input` function allow us to request for input values from the console. Once the use inputs a value, this will be pass as an argument to the built-in function `int`, which we are using to coerce explicitly the return value from the `input` function, which is of type `string` to an integer value. If the coercion is successful, the returned value of type integer is assigned to the global variable `day`.

On line 3, we have a formatted-string, denoted by the presence of the prefix `f` before the string object with value `Today is the {day} of {month}`. At runtime, the values referenced by the variables `day` and `month` are coerced implicitly into a string object, and interpolated into the string, which is then pass as an argument to the `print` function invocation, which outputs the value into the console.

> Your explanation correctly identifies both explicit and implicit coercion in the code snippet, which is the main focus of the question. Here's a detailed breakdown of your answer:
> 
> **Strengths:**
> •   You correctly identified that `int(input(...))` is an explicit coercion from string to integer  
> •   You accurately noted that string interpolation in the f-string implicitly coerces values to strings  
> •   Your explanation provides good line-by-line analysis of the code
> 
> **Areas for Improvement:**
> 1.  ​**About the implicit coercion in f-strings**​:  
>    According to the [Type Conversions assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a29e9831/assignments/ed956456), when you use string interpolation, "Python automatically coerces the values to strings using the `str()` function." This is a bit more specific than just saying values are "coerced implicitly into a string object."
>    2.  ​**About the `print()` function**​:  
>    The assignment specifically notes: "`print()` isn't considered to be coercion. While it does coerce its arguments to strings, that is done behind the scenes. It doesn't return the resulting strings; it just prints them." Your explanation implies that the string is passed to `print()` which then outputs it, but doesn't clarify this specific distinction.
>    3.  ​**Minor technical details**​:  
>    •   There's a typo where you say "Once the use inputs a value" instead of "user"  
>    •   The explanation could be more precise about variable initialization (e.g., mentioning that variables are binding names to objects)
>    
>    For a more complete answer, you could have also mentioned that if the user inputs a non-numeric value, the explicit coercion using `int()` would raise a `ValueError` as noted in the assignment.
>    
>    Overall, your answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of type coercion in Python, both explicit and implicit, but could benefit from more precision in the technical language used and addressing the specific handling of coercion in the `print()` function.

### 2: What does this print and why, what concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def addition(number1, number2):
    number1 += number2

x = 1
y = 2

addition(x, y)
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```


### 3. What does this print and why? What concept does this cover? How would you refactor this to remove the space?

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2))
```

### 4. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
name = 'Alexander Graham Bell'
print(name[0])
```

### 5. What does this print and why?

```python
string1 = "HelloWorld"
string2 = "12345"
string3 = "Hello World"

result1 = string1.isalpha()
result2 = string2.isalpha()
result3 = string3.isalpha()

print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string1), result1)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string2), result2)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string3), result3)
```

### 6. What do these print and why?

```python
s1 = "123abc"
print(s1.isdigit())
s2 = "123$%^"
print(s2.isdigit())
s3 = ""
print(s3.isdigit())
s4 = "12345"
print(s4.isdigit())
```

### 7. What do these print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in my_list)
print(6 not in my_list)
```

### 8. What do these print and why?

```python
temperature = 25
time_of_day = "morning"

if temperature < 30 and (time_of_day == "morning" or time_of_day == "afternoon"):
    print("It's a pleasant day!")
else:
    print("It's either too hot or not the right time of day.")
```

### 9. What does this code print and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def number_range(number):
    match number:
        case n if n < 0:
            print(f'{number} is less than 0')
        case n if n <= 50:
            print(f'{number} is between 0 and 50')
        case n if 50 < n <= 100:
            print(f'{number} is between 51 and 100')
        case _:
            print(f'{number} is greater than 100')
number_range(0)
number_range(25)
```

### 10. What does this print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ele = my_list.pop()
print("Popped element:", ele)
print("List after popping:", my_list)
ele1 = my_list.pop(1)
print("Popped element at index 1:", ele1)
print("Modified list after popping at index 1:", my_list)
```
