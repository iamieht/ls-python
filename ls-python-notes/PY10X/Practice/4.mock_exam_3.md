# Mock Exam #3

### 1: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
month = "December"
day = int(input("What day is it? "))
print(f"Today is the {day} of {month}")
```

### 2: What does this print and why, what concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def addition(number1, number2):
    number1 += number2

x = 1
y = 2

addition(x, y)
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept does this cover? How would you refactor this to remove the space?

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2))
```

### 4. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
name = 'Alexander Graham Bell'
print(name[0])
```

### 5. What does this print and why?

```python
string1 = "HelloWorld"
string2 = "12345"
string3 = "Hello World"

result1 = string1.isalpha()
result2 = string2.isalpha()
result3 = string3.isalpha()

print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string1), result1)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string2), result2)
print("Is '{}' alphabetic?".format(string3), result3)
```

### 6. What do these print and why?

```python
s1 = "123abc"
print(s1.isdigit())
s2 = "123$%^"
print(s2.isdigit())
s3 = ""
print(s3.isdigit())
s4 = "12345"
print(s4.isdigit())
```

### 7. What do these print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in my_list)
print(6 not in my_list)
```

### 8. What do these print and why?

```python
temperature = 25
time_of_day = "morning"

if temperature < 30 and (time_of_day == "morning" or time_of_day == "afternoon"):
    print("It's a pleasant day!")
else:
    print("It's either too hot or not the right time of day.")
```

### 9. What does this code print and why? What concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def number_range(number):
    match number:
        case n if n < 0:
            print(f'{number} is less than 0')
        case n if n <= 50:
            print(f'{number} is between 0 and 50')
        case n if 50 < n <= 100:
            print(f'{number} is between 51 and 100')
        case _:
            print(f'{number} is greater than 100')
number_range(0)
number_range(25)
```

### 10. What does this print and why?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ele = my_list.pop()
print("Popped element:", ele)
print("List after popping:", my_list)
ele1 = my_list.pop(1)
print("Popped element at index 1:", ele1)
print("Modified list after popping at index 1:", my_list)
```
