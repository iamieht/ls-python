# Practice Problems 4

## 1.  What will this code print? What concepts are being demonstrated?

```python
def double_numbers(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i] *= 2
    return numbers

my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = double_numbers(my_numbers)
print(result)
print(my_numbers)
```

## 2.  What will be the output of this code? What Python feature is being used in the function?

```python
def greet(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
```

## 3.  What will this code print? What concept is it illustrating?

```python
def create_multiplier(factor):
    def multiplier(x):
        return x * factor
    return multiplier

double = create_multiplier(2)
print(double(5))
```

## 4.  What will be the output of this code? What is the purpose of the inner function?

```python
def outer():
    count = 0
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inner

counter = outer()
print(counter())
print(counter())
print(counter())
```


## 5.  What will this code print? What method is being used on the string?

```python
def capitalize_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    capitalized = [word.capitalize() for word in words]
    return " ".join(capitalized)

result = capitalize_words("python is awesome")
print(result)
```


## 6.  What will be the output of this code? What concept is it demonstrating?

```python
def apply_operation(operation, numbers):
    results = []
    for num in numbers:
        results.append(operation(num))
    return results

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = apply_operation(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
print(squared)
```


## 7.  What will this code print? What Python feature is being illustrated?

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```


## 8.  What will be the output of this code? What concept is it demonstrating?

```python
def filter_even(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_even(my_numbers)
print(result)
```

## 9.  What will this code print? What method is being used on the dictionary?

```python
def sum_values(dictionary):
    total = 0
    for value in dictionary.values():
        total += value
    return total

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
result = sum_values(my_dict)
print(result)
```


## 10. What will be the output of this code? What concept is it illustrating?

```python
def generate_sequence(n):  
    for i in range(n):  
        yield i ** 2  
  
for num in generate_sequence(5):  
    print(num)
```
