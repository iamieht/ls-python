### 1. What can be used in place of commas to make this more readable?

```python
print(123112940)
```

**Answer**

We can use underscores to make large numbers more readable. Works for both integer values and float values.

```python
print(123_112_940)
print(3.14_15)
```

### 2. What do these print and why?

```python
print("Hello World".isalnum())
print("Hello@World".isalnum())
print("".isalnum())
print("Hello123".isalnum())
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is:

`False`
`False`
`False`
`True`

The `isalnum` method, checks every character of a string and returns `True` if all characters are alphanumeric, meaning any of the following characters `(A-Z)`, `(a-z)`, `(0-9)`, or `False` if at least one character is not alphanumeric.

The concept demonstrated here is string methods, specifically the `isalnum` method.
### 3. What do these print and why?

```python
name = 'HELLO'

if name.isupper():
    print("WORLD")
else:
    print("world")
    ```

**Answer**

This code outputs `WORLD`.

On line 1, we initialize a global variable `name` to reference a string object with value `HELLO`.

On line 3, we have a conditional statement, in which we invoke the `isupper()` method on the value referenced by `name`. The method returns `True` if all the characters of the string object are uppercased, `False` otherwise. In this case, it returns `True` as  the string `HELLO` has only uppercased characters. As `True` is truthy, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.

On line 4, we invoke the `print()` function and pass in the string object with value `WORLD` as an argument, which is output to the console.

The concept demonstrated here is Truthiness, which is how values are evaluated in a Boolean context. The following values are falsy in Python:

- `0`, `0.0`, `0j`.
- `False`
- `None`
- `""`
- All empty collections

Any other value is truthy.

Additionally the string method `isupper` is demonstrated.

### 4. What does this print and why?

```python
num = 12

if num / 3 < 3 and num > 10:
    print("Hello")
elif num >= 8 and num < 6 or num > 4 and num < 16:
    print("Hello 2")
elif num % 4 == 0 or num < 7 and num < 10:
    print("Hello 3")
else:
    print("Buy")
```

**Answer**

The output is `Hello 2`.

On line 1, a global variable `num` is initialized and references an integer object with value `12`.

On line 3, we have a conditional statement and the first evaluated expression is `num / 3 < 3 and num > 10` . This evaluates to `False`, as the left operand is evaluated first `num / 3 < 3` , which evaluates to `False` and due to short circuiting when using the `and` operator, the right operand is not evaluated.

On line 5, the following expression is evaluated `num >= 8 and num < 6 or num > 4 and num < 16`. The left operand `num >= 8` is evaluated first, and evaluates to `True`. Then the operand `num < 16` is evaluated second, and it evaluates to `True`. Then `num > 4` evaluates to `True`. Up to this point the expression looks like this: `True and num < 6 or True and True`. The expression `num < 6` evaluates to `False`, so the expression so far looks like this: `True and False or True and True`. The next steps of the evaluation looks like this: `False or True`, which evaluates to `True`. The code block within the `elif` statement is then executed.

On line 6, we invoke the `print` function with the string `Hello 2` as an argument, outputting it to the console.

The concept demonstrated here is logical operations and precedence.


### 5. What does this print and why?

```python
elements = [0, 1 , 2, "Dima"]
print(elements.reverse())
print(elements)
```

**Answer**

This code outputs:

`None`
`[Dina, 2, 1, 0]`

On line 1, the global variable `elements` is initialized and references a list object with the values `[0, 1, 2, "Dima"]`

On line 2, we invoke the `reverse()` method on the list object referenced by `elements`, mutating the list in place by reversing its elements. This method returns `None`, which is pass as an argument to the `print` function, outputting it to the console.

On line 3, we invoke the `print` function and pass in the value referenced by `elements` as an argument, outputting the list to the console with its elements in reverse order.

The concept demonstrated here is mutability by invoking a mutating method, in this case `reverse()`, on a list object.


### 6. What does this print and why?

```python
ages = {
    "dimo": 31,
    "olena": 32,
    "tetiana": 28
}

def get_val_of_dimo(info):
    try:
        info['dimo']
        return info['dimo']
    except KeyError:
        return "Typo"

print(get_val_of_dimo(ages))
```

### 7. What does this print and why?

```python
var = 10

def function1():
    var = 20
    print(var)

function1()

try:
    print(var)
except NameError:
    print("Error occurred")

def function2():
    var += 5
    print(var)

try:
    function2()
except UnboundLocalError:
    print("Error occurred")

def function3():
    global var
    var += 5
    print(var)

function3()
print(var)
```


### 8. What does this print and why?

```python
var = 10

def function1():
    print(var)

function1()

def function2():
    var = 20
    print(var)

function2()
print(var)
```

###  9. What do these print and why?
```python
def punctuation_type(str):
    if str == str.upper():
        print('This is all caps')
    elif str == str.lower():
        print('This is all lowercase')
    else:
        print('Neither')

str1 = 'HELLO'
str2 = 'yolo'
str3 = 'My Name Is: '

punctuation_type(str1)
punctuation_type(str2)
punctuation_type(str3)
```

### 10. What do these print and why?

```python
str1 = "    "
str2 = "  Hello   "
str3 = "Hello World"

print(str1.isspace())
print(str2.isspace())
print(str3.isspace())

sentence = "Hello     World!   How are you?   "
word_count = sum(1 for word in sentence.split() if not word.isspace())
print("Number of words in the sentence:", word_count)
```
