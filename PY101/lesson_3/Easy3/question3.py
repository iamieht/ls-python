# What will the following code output?
str1 = "hello there"
str2 = str1
str2 = "goodbye!"
print(str1) # hello there

# The output is hello there. In Python, assignment of one variable's value to another variable makes both variables point to the same object. Thus, after running line 2, both str1 and str2 reference the same string object. However, that connection between the variables is broken if you assign a different object to one of the variables. Thus, line 3 breaks the connection between str1 and str2. As a result, str2 now references "goodbye!" while str1 continues to reference "hello there".
