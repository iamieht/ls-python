# Will the code below raise an error?
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[6] = 5

# This code raises an exception as we are trying to modify an element at index 6 to reference the integer 5 but that index doesn't exist in the list.
print(numbers)

# LS Solution: It will raise an error. This error is a result of 6 being an out of range index: the only indexes currently defined for the numbers list are 0, 1, and 2. Any attempt to access or modify an element at an index that does not exist will result in an IndexError exception.
