# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.
# print(greeting)

# greeting = 'Hello world!'

# a NameError is raised as the global variable greeting is being passed as an argument into the print function but it is not yet initialized.
# In Python, you must initialize a variable before you use it; otherwise, it raises a NameError indicating the name hasn't been defined.
