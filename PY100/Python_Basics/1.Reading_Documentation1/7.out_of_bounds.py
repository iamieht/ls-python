# What happens if we take the list ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access the element at index position 10? First try to determine what will happen by consulting the documentation, then verify your understanding in the Python REPL.

# The Python documentation, as of December 2023, doesn't mention what happens if the index position is out of bounds.

lst = ['fish', 'and', 'chips']
print(lst[10])
