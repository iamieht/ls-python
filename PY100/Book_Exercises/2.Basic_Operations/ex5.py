# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:
foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# will this result in an error?: Yes!, it will result in an index out of range error, as there is no element with index 3 in the foo list.
print(foo[3])
